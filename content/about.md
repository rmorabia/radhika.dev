I’m a Frontend Developer specialized in Vue, React, and JavaScript.

More importantly, I have the desire, willingness, and ability to learn new things at a rapid pace. I also prefer to learn new things that are related to the web.

If you want to dive deeper, I document my learning casually on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/radhikamorabia), and more formally on [my blog](http://rmorabia.com/posts).

Traditionally, there would be a Skills list here. Instead, here are a list of things I would prefer to not learn. (If you think I should change my mind about this list, [drop me an email](hi@rmorabia.com).)

## Not Skills

* COBOL
* Angular (1.x — ∞)
* Java
* PHP

That’s about it!

In my ideal world, I’d prefer to work on a web app which uses JavaScript (plain, Vue, or React) on the front-end, and Python or Node.js on the back-end.

If you still want to know what exactly it is that I know, here is my current list of skills. This list is constantly changing as I learn new things.

This list is in no particular order.

## Skills

* JavaScript/ES6+
* Vue/Vuex
* React/Redux
* Electron/Cordova
* Webpack
* SQL
* Node.js
* Git
* HTML
* CSS/Sass
* CS fundamentals in a JavaScript context
* Cypress

To end this off, here is a random fun fact about me:
