**Coding Time:** Half Day


**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished Learning [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

I finally finished this book! It took way longer than I thought it would, but I'm glad it's done. I really enjoyed it, not only for the specifics of the technical content, but for teaching me about clean code and accessibility practices. It was also a really good testing ground for my learning methods going forward. I'm going to be moving onto much more complicated stuff (JavaScript), and I can't afford to experiment with something that's fundamentally much more difficult. 


Here are my notes for Sections 11 & 12:

```
## tables

* table `<caption>` is the way to title your table
* use colspan and rowspan to make a specific data point take up multiple spots
* css row separate will stack the borders from the cell and from the table on top of each other
* scope (attribute) row, col, colgroup, rowgroup to say where a header applies to

## clean code

* use comments LIBERALLY to organize code
* if the image doesn't need an alt text, include it and leave it blank
* use as few divs as possible
* use css IDs as little as possible
* in CSS, if the value is 0, write 0, not 0px/0%
* vender prefix: keep ABOVE the real elements
```

## Continued [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I went up to Lesson 48 of 53. I really tried to finish this one today, but once I started, I felt my eyes burning. It's fine.

Here are my notes from today:

```
* or just `git pull` to do both ^
* `git branch --track [local folder] [remote folder]` to create a new branch that tracks a remote branch
```

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I'll quickly wrap up the Git book in the morning. After that, this weekend is basically a mini-Hackathon to finish the site. 

Here's what's left:

- Fix where the intro button links (negative margin)
- Actively highlight the link in the menu if I'm in that section 
- Choose a font!!
- Complete the experience section
- Complete & grid-ify the projects section with 6 cards
- Complete the Contact section
- Complete the footer

Will I finish it tomorrow? I don't know if a full day of focused work like that will help or hurt me. Regardless, I'm pretty confident I'll finish it by Monday. After that, it's a tiny bit of Flexbox & SASS, then I'm off to learn JavaScript!
