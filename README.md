# Radhika Morabia's personal website

This is a static website made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I designed it myself with loads of help from the [Spectre CSS Framework](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

Right now, the site is made entirely in HTML & CSS. I hope to add JavaScript & CSS animations in once I get a good handle on them.

The site is a never-ending work in progress.
