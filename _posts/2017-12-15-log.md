**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Continued to Learn the Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)

I really don't want to turn into a book learner. I don't believe you need to go through a book 100% to get going, get started, and get to making real things. Making things teaches you a lot more than just going through a book and doing examples. The further I get into this book, the more I feel like I should skim faster and faster.

So today, I skimmed through **Section 10: Grep and Regular Expressions**. I can see where this becomes useful in debugging large files, sometime down the line. However, I won't be debugging in the command line. I'll be debugging in my text editor of choice. (Currently, that's Atom, but I really haven't decided.) I have one line of notes from this:

```
* egrep is the command for regular expressions, which can help you find data that matches a particular pattern
```

If Grep is relevant within my IDE/text editor, I'll learn it within the confines of that particular editor. It's probably more graphical and has specific quirks.

Next up? **Section 11: Piping and Redirection.**

Here are my notes from the very useful section:

```
* [command] > [location] will save a log of the output from that command
	* '>>' to add the output to an existing file instead of > replacing it
	* use 2 (stream 2: error stream) to write errors to log. eg. ls video.mpg 2> errors.txt
		* to do both, &1. eg. ls -l video.mpeg vi3 > myoutput 2>&1
* < to redirect FROM a file, eg. wc -l < myoutput
	* still not sure how this is useful but whatever
* piping | splice multiple programs together. the output from the first command is the input for the second program. it can run forever. eg. ls | head -2
```

There are only 2.5 sections left. I expect to finish this within a day or two.


## Continued [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

Today, I started on Week 1 of the course. I think I'm sticking with this course instead of any other course. It's hard enough for a video course to hold my attention. The production quality and the general enthusiasm the professor has for really making things simple have kept me moderately captivated.

I watched the lecture for Week 1 today, which 2 hours and 10 minutes long. It was dense. I feel the muscles in my thighs going numb from sitting still for so long. It covered a lot in one day, without breaks for implementation. This covers my fundamental problem with university-style learning &/or video learning at large. I wanted to stop when David covered "Hello world" in C. I wanted to pause and try that code for myself. Before I could, he moved onto math. Then, he moved onto real-world problems with binary overflow. I couldn't stop at all. Technically, I could've because it's an online video with the Pause button, but I didn't feel like there was any proper stopping point.

It's a really interesting introduction to *Computer Science*, though. It's not just about code, it's about understanding why the code works that should serve as a fundamental block for any area of coding that the student would later go into. I think I'll invest a bit more time into it even though it feels slightly wasteful because of the broad application.

I don't think the lectures exist to help with the coding, though. This course is way more like iterative project learning with supplemental videos rather than videos with supplemental Problem Sets/homework. I don't know if I'm a fan of that or not. I like the really dumbed down way of exploring CS *concepts* in the lectures, though. I don't know how useful it'll be in my future. Will it stick with me and fundamentally change my ideas about computers & coding? I don't know, but I like it.

We are supposed to code all of our projects in the online IDE C9, which I'm not sure I'm a fan of. It's slower than working in Atom/any local IDE. My computer & my wifi aren't very fast, so that extra RAM/bandwidth being eaten by working in another computer in the browser isn't the most ideal situation. It's also not the best way to develop independent coding skills. Regardless, I don't want to cause problems between the automatic grading system and my local code, so I'll learn C9.

This week, we began to learn C. The problem set this week is 4 (already?!) small C projects that build incrementally on top of each other. Here is my source code for each one:

*Spent 2.5 hours on these first two projects tonight*

**Hello, World!** (Source provided by the course, our job was simply to run it in the IDE)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

**How many bottles of water do you user per minute in the shower?**

Typical liberal college projects focusing on environmentalism. I found that funny. This was the first self-coded project. I felt completely lost. I already forgot all of the syntax in C. I went back into the lecture just see an example of how the syntax in C actually works. I also needed the hint (in the walkthrough) of which function I'm supposed to use.

Once I got the first half (input minutes), the rest came easily. I checked every new line by re-compiling and running the program to make sure it still worked to the specifications I wanted. The int names aren't as intuitive as I would like, but I didn't want to waste time going back and making them perfect.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("How many minutes did you shower? ");
    int n = get_int();
    printf("Minutes: %i\n", n);

    int b = n * 12;
    printf("Bottles: %i\n", b);
}
```

That's all I finished today. There are two more left. Here's where I left off with the third exercise — building a virtual staircase based on the integer provided by the user. I'm still not even finished with actually making sure the user inputs the correct integer to render the staircases. I have to browse through the lecture & the corresponding videos to find the missing links in my brain tomorrow.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <cs50.h>

int main(void)
{    printf("Height: ");
    int h = get_int();
    if (h < 23)
    {
        printf("%i\n", h);
    }
    else
    while (true)
    {
        printf("Height: ");
        int g = get_int();
        printf("%i\n", g);
    }

}
```


## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Finish Week 1 of CS50x. Optionally, conquer both the less comfortable & the more comfortable versions of each exercise. It may make Week 2 and so on easier.

*Optional:* Upload all of my source code from the CS50 project into a public GitHub folder called CS50? As long as I publish it here, I can choose to do this at a later point. I'm not sure how useful this will be, or if it's good only for the sake of completion.

Complete Section 12 of the command line guide.

Still got time? Finish the rest of the CLI guide.
