**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Started [JavaScript30](http://javascript30.com) Day 1

This took a lot longer than I expected. Day 1 just happened to be all of the things I've never done before.

The app only has two requirements (and the CSS/HTML is already pre-built):

1. When the user presses the correct letter on the keyboard, play a short animation on the corresponding box.
2. When the user presses the correct letter on the keyboard, play the corresponding sound.

That's not so hard, right! Well, I've never had a user play a sound, trigger an animation, or checked for the correct key being pressed.

So, today I figured out how to get the right key. I figured out how to trigger the animation, too.

What's left is playing the sound and turning the animation off when the sound is pressed.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Continue with JavaScript30.

My new & updated list of things I need to do before I finish with vanilla JavaScript is as follows:

Courses/Linear Things:

1. JavaScript30
2. JavaScript: The Weird Parts
3. Intro to AJAX on Udacity
4. JavaScript Design Patterns on Udacity

Things to Read/Watch Videos About:

1. ES6
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Functional Programming

And of course, we shouldn't forget building projects along the way. Although, I'm pretty sure for as long as I'm doing JS30, the difficulty of the first one suggests that this is all the appetite I have for projects.
