**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Nearly Finished Building my [Todo List](http://rmorabia.com/todo)

In some ways, this was the easiest project I've done to date. In other ways, it's the hardest. I don't know. I have very mixed feelings about it. 

All but 2 of the requirements are done:

1. There's a bug when clicking the delete button span sometimes.
2. I want to add a feature where the corresponding delete button only shows up when you hover over the element you want to delete.

This project constitutes the most time I've had to ask for help and the cleanest/easiest code I've ever written. I don't know. It's complicated.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Finish this app. 

Start JavaScrip30.

If time, move on to theory learning in some way again.
