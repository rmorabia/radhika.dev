**Coding Time:** 2 hours

I took a health hiatus. I tried to get back into the groove today.

**Here's what I did today:**

## Worked a bit on the design of the [Alia app](http://alia.glitch.me)

I just did some CSS work to get back into the groove. The first half of the CSS is nearly done. I just need to style the button.

Was some of that work Photoshop-y? Why yes, it was.

Then, I have to still:

* Have the app run on button click
* Create a countdown timer
* Restyle the 2nd page in a whole different way without refreshing the page (this sounds like the hardest part)
* Change the background image to be the image from the API data
* Add the other API data like director and stuff
* Add attribution & a little thing to see who built the thing 
* Fix it for mobile because the h1 is too big for mobile right now
* Be sure I chose the right picture! I was down to the final 2 and I can't decide.

There's a lot left to do. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I am exhausted, so I don't know. Continue working on the app? Learn about promises? JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts?
