This is a full list of my learning goals for 2020. Each of these topics will be linked out into their own separate blog posts if I have a fleshed out idea of how I'm learning it.

I want to learn **Algorithms & Data Structures**. This is just at an interview level. I'll probably complete a few courses, then I want to practice doing 1-2 problems a week.

I want to learn **post-v16 React**. This doesn't need to be super comprehensive, it can just be going through [one Egghead course of whatever feels relevant per week](https://egghead.io).

I want to learn **[Node from a back-end perspective, not a full-stack perspective](https://radhika.dev/master-node)**.

I want to learn **testing**. I kinda know Jest, I kinda know Mocha, I kind of know Chai, I kinda know Cypress, but knowing the frameworks doesn't mean I know how to _test_.

I want to learn **system design/software architecture**. I want to know enough about this to confidently feel like a mid-level engineer who can make and contribute to decisions by the end of next year. Start with [Khalil Stemmler's blog post on this](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/full-stack-software-design/).

I want to finish **[CS50](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science)**. Earlier, I said I wanted to do a complete Freshman-level CS. I now think that's too ambitious. I just want an Intro to CS, and then to move onto Algorithms & Data Structures. The other stuff can wait until it feels more relevant.

I want to learn **[Java](https://radhika.dev/learn-java/)**.
