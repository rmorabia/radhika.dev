**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Got a refund for Modern JavaScript from the Beginning

The fact that the introductory section was teaching me too much syntax was a bad sign.

I skipped forward to check the OOP section... He drove straight into constructor function syntax.

I skipped forward to the AJAX section... He nearly jumped straight forward into syntax.

I'm switching back to Udacity for this intermediate stuff.

Look, here's what I wanted to learn, right?

* AJAX/Async/APIs -- Udacity has it.
* OOP -- Udacity has it.
* Design Patterns -- Udacity has it.
* ES6 -- Udacity has it.

They're free, they have projects, and they're better produced. So what if they take me longer to get through? I'm ready. Shortcuts don't work.

Again, the difference is yet again that no one covers functional programming.

That's fine. You know who does cover everything? Kyle Simpson. I've been listening to a lot of interviews with him and I like him a lot. I'm not scared of his books anymore. I think I can pick them up again. I _really_ liked the exercise in the first book. I can do this.

Take the time to find the right thing. It's okay.

Also, the refund was only $10 even though I am pretty sure I spent $12. I guess it was worth the $2 difference. 

## Jumped straight into [Udacity: Intro to AJAX](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-ajax--ud110)

This one is super super short (6 hours). It's an easy introduction to Udacity's style. If I hate it, hey, I only wasted a day. If I love it, there's a whole lot more where that came from.

I've definitely decided that the whole scattershot approach with articles and YouTube nonsense is not for me. I can't connect isolated dots to anything. I need more structure. I need introductions to topics first.

When I run out of these Udacity courses, I always have [Frontend Masters](http://frontendmasters.com), which has video courses on a ton of pretty advanced topics. It's expensive, but I'm sure it's worth it.

If not, MDN/Docs are better than random articles. Or, again, I just have to get used to reading books again.

Anyway, onto the Udacity course...

I like the soft intros. I like to be introduced to a concept before I get thrown into the syntax. I have to know what exactly it is that syntax is doing.

AJAX is a thing (still unknown) that handles Asynchronous requests, which are things (???) that can run in the background, either before or after a page has loaded. So, this doesn't interfere with static page loading, this is its own dynamic thing.

AJAX usually comes back in the form of a JSON file, which looks a lot like a JavaScript object. It can also apparently come back as HTML, but who would want that?

Then, there was a quiz. Oh my god. These quizzes are the most amateurish thing. I swear this isn't a browser problem -- I'm using Chrome. But, the question was "Which of the following actions on Facebook could not happen without asynchronous requests?" & it was silly. It gives you the answers right there.

It's good to see real-life examples of what asynchronous requests look like (I now understand theoretically that I need them in my next project), but these quizzes are so amateurish. 

So, I finished the first 2 hour lesson. It wasn't 2 hours. I don't actually know how long it took me, but I think it was about an hour.  There was no actionable syntax in it. It was just an introduction to the concept and use-cases. I like that, I think? I also don't like it, if there's no payoff. If the actionable part of the lesson proceeds to be as hand-holding, then I need to find something else.

On with the second lesson!

Err... I think they're trying to make me use jQuery to write AJAX functions. Err... No... Nope... This is bad. 

Switching over to YouTube, I guess? 

## Learned about how to use APIs in JavaScript thanks to [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJaXOFfwGVw) & [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction)

Ironically, a lot of the top videos on APIs when you search YouTube are by Brad Traversy, the guy who made the course I just got a refund for. 

Dan (The Coding Train) has a whole series about APIs and data in JavaScript! My only concern is that he's using p5.js, which is a JavaScript framework a lot like jQuery.

I watched the early video tutorials in the playlist to get a further theoretical understanding of what AJAX/Async/APIs are. I understand how to parse JSON & APIs a bit more. If I need more examples, I can go further with more of his examples.

I still don't know how to use the syntax in vanilla JS. In p5.js, it's `loadJSON`. So, I need another non-framework example. 

I went to watch other videos, but I just ended up looking at MDN/Codepens. 

As far as I can tell, it's different with each API? I don't really understand. 

This is the script for MDN's first example: 

```js
 if("geolocation" in navigator) {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
   var latlng = new google.maps.LatLng(position.coords.latitude,position.coords.longitude);
        var myOptions = {
          zoom: 8,
          center: latlng,
          mapTypeId: google.maps.MapTypeId.TERRAIN,
          disableDefaultUI: true
        }
        var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById("map_canvas"), myOptions);
      });
    } else {
      var para = document.createElement('p');
      para.textContent = 'Argh, no geolocation!';
      document.body.appendChild(para);
    }
```

This looks NOTHING like Dan's `loadJSON` or Udacity's `XMLHttpRequest`.  I don't understand where the request even starts. This seems to use entirely custom syntax. 

I've heard this before, but I didn't really think that APIs would be that different! So apparently, if you want to work with APIs, after knowing the basics of how APIs generally work, you just need to practice to get going.

Well, I guess I'm as ready as I'll ever be? 

## Vaguely Started My [Alia App](http://rmorabia.com/alia)

Before I really knew what JavaScript did, my magnum opus would be a dynamically updated countdown timer to [Alia Bhatt's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alia_Bhatt) next movie. It seemed fun and silly, but most importantly, it seemed like a technological marvel to create.

The FreeCodeCamp recommendation for the first app is a Local Weather app. This would use both a weather API and the browser API for getting someone's current location. That actually sounds harder than my silly Alia app.

So, I'm going to be using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). I could use IMDB, they usually have more up-to-date information, but I wanted to use pictures, too.

The basic outline of how the app is going to be is as follows:

* Blurred background image to start with 
* "When is Alia Bhatt's next movie coming out?" + cute animated button to trigger AJAX call
* Page reloads without a refresh to change the blurred background image to the movie's poster
* "Alia's next movie is BLANK!" + Countdown timer to the time when Alia's next movie comes out
* Some ancillary information like "It's directed by []"
* Some cool transparent effects

There's 3 main components to this:

* I want a really nice, responsive design that's made entirely by me. No frameworks. Just me, the grid, the fancy CSS effects.
* I want it to reload the page without actually reloading the page.
* I want a countdown timer to adapt dynamically to the next movie's date.

So, to focus on the API part, I'm going to ignore the design and the timer. All I'm trying to do is use the API to load the information I want in plain text.

It still sounds hard. I need the API to do a search on a specific person, then sort the movies list by date, then find the first one that's past the current date, then extract the data from that page.

It seems a bit specific. I'm looking at the [API examples](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover) and none even come close to what I want to do. They have release-date/release-year & they have with_people, but nothing like that together.

I can already tell this is going to use a lot of variables. 

My main resources for this are [TMDB's own documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) (which is really, really good!) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started). There's a copy/paste plug & play component to TMDB's documentation, which I want to avoid. I want to figure out how to make it work on my own. 

I ran into a snag when trying to return the JSON object from the AJAX call. It turns out, that's not possible! Not without Promises! (That's on my to-understand list.)

So, you have to run ALL the code within the function scope. 

It makes the code super messy and ugly to read, but I made it work.

Today, all I did was get the current date (not the time for the countdown timer) to compare to the dates of Alia's movies, and show the next release date.

Honestly, that's a lot in the grand scheme of things. The minimum viable version of the app is up there.

If you click on it, there's nothing fancy, but I promise you -- it's fancy. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Either continue the app as is or invest in learning about promises?

Here are the rest of the Udemy courses I want to get through:

1. JavaScript Promises
2. Object Oriented JavaScript
3. Asynchronous JavaScript Requests
4. JavaScript Design Patterns

**BONUS:**

* ES6
* JavaScript Testing

We'll see how far I get before they throw some jQuery nonsense at me again.

I really wanted to get to The Weird Parts today, but I got so caught up in the app. There's always tomorrow.
