**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Started [FreeCodeCamp's Basic JavaScript Track](http://freecodecamp.org)

What's that? A few days off? Yeah. I took a bit of time off because I just didn't have a positive gut feeling about any of the books I chose. They focused too much on jQuery or their code examples were only enough to understand the concepts -- not to apply them to a real project.

So, I took some time to think through how to bridge this gap between knowing basic JavaScript concepts and syntax, and actually being able to do something with it. Well, the something I want to do is a FreeCodeCamp project anyway, right? Why not follow the FreeCodeCamp curriculum before that? It should theoretically prepare me for the Intermediate Frontend Projects.

At a minimum, it's an interactive coding environment that I can do at my own pace instead of falling behind watching videos.

Here were the lessons I finished today (out of about 100):

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I could've gotten further, but I'm trying to adjust my sleep schedule to get more things done in the beginning of the day. I hope to come close to finishing this section tomorrow. The day after, I'll finish it up & finish up the OOP/FP section as well. 

Still keeping that Udemy course somewhere in the backburner here.
