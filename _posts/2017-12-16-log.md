**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished Learning [the Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)

Section 12 was on handling processes. Pretty useful, although I knew it all from frantic StackOverflow searches.

```
* top is like task manager, view all processes
* ps (-aux for whole system) shows an alternative way of looking at processes including the PID
	* eg. ps aux | grep 'firefox' to get the PID of firefox
* kill PID to stop a process
	* kill -9 PID to be AGGRESSIVE when plain doesn't work
* linux runs on multiple consoles (wtf?) and we're usually on 7.
	* you can access the other consoles by typing Ctrl + Alt + F(Console). this is useful when Console 7 locks up
	* sleep runs a program for a given number of seconds and then kills it
	* eg. sleep [number of seconds] (optional: '&' to run sleep in the background)
	* **Ctrl + Z moves the current foreground process into the background for the terminal** (useful when git pushing?)
* fg brings background processes to the foreground
* jobs shows all the background jobs
```

Section 13 was on Bash scripting. I mostly skimmed through this as I haven't thought of a single thing that would be particularly useful to handle with a script. I may down the line, but not yet. Regardless, here are my notes:

```
* save script as script.sh for easy finding
* start all scripts with #!/bin/bash
* just write whatever commands you would write manually in the command line, but then it does it automatically
* run by putting ./ in front of your script name. eg. ./myscript.sh
* variables:
	* syntax to set it up: name='Radhika'
	* syntax to use it $name
	* eg. r='90' $r
* use ` to represent the output of a command
* find finds files that fit certain arguments
```

It feels good to finally be finished with this, and to generally be finished with the first step on the path I'm following. This took much longer than I anticipated, but I learned quite a bit. I'm just glad to finally have free time for other books/courses.

## Continued [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

I didn't get through the same problem I was stuck on yesterday. I was at it for hours, but I felt like I was missing something. Currently, I know exactly what I want the code to do, I just don't know how to make it do it.

This course is nice and all, but I don't think I can afford the time to sit through and do the deep university thinking. I have to learn to code. I can learn CS later.

I'm going to finish Week 1's Problem Set and then put this on hold. At this pace, I don't know how long even that's going to take. I may visit it from time to time, but I'm not doing it now. I will pick it back up once I'm ready to apply for jobs. That way, I won't feel like I'm wasting time.

There's this current problem I'm halfway done with, and then one more problem (which may be even easier than this one according to some sources). Then, I'm done.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Start Shay Howe's [HTML/CSS course](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). Woo! Onto semi-real coding.

Finish Week 1 of CS50x. I probably won't get it in even one more day, but I will try.
