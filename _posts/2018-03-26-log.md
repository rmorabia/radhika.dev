**Coding Time:** Full Day

I took my first real day off in months yesterday. It was weird. It was very hard to come out of. So, despite the lack of productive work today, I did attempt to code for the entire day.

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Learned About Monads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QveBbn7t_c)

A monad is like a functor, except it has the extra bonus level of being able to implement a flatmap and a map. An example of a monad is actually the `.then` in promises, because it "flattens" the promise the value of the promise instead of just returning us the promise itself.

Clearly, we're getting to the point where functional programming goes straight over my head and straight into the pile of things I'll forget. So, I'm done for now.

I know that functional programming is about using more Array methods, making each function do just one thing, and using parameters and `return`s a lot more. So, I'll do that.

## Continued [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http//udemy.com/understand-javascript)

Today, we continued to talk about Object-Oriented JavaScript. I finally made a breakthrough on what constructor functions actually are. `new` is what creates the object, and you run the constructor function every time to define the inside of that empty object. the `this` in a constructor function maps to the object that `new` created. So, the function just acts as a template -- no matter where it's defined. Syntatically, it's understood that constructor functions are named like `Object` rather than in camelCase.

So, now I just don't understand what `Classes` have to do with any of this.

We can use object prototypes to add methods and properties to ANY/ALL objects that are created with the constructor function. (We do this outside of the constructor function.) Why would we want to do this? All constructor functions pull from one prototype (in memory), so it's MUCH more efficient to pull from one prototype rather than 1000 individual object properties.

Also, any time the word new is used, whatever comes after this is a constructor function. JavaScript even has some built in! For example, in `new Date()`, Date is just a constructor function from JavaScript.

Here's how far I am in the course:

1. [X] Section 1: Getting Started 5 / 5
2. [X] Section 2: Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments 13 / 13
3. [X] Section 3: Types and Operators 11 / 11
4. [X] Section 4: Objects and Functions 23 / 23
5. [X] Section 5: Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance 4 / 4
6. [ ] Section 6: Building Objects 6 / 8
7. [ ] Section 7: Odds and Ends 0 / 4
8. [ ] Section 8: Examining Famous Frameworks and Libraries 0 / 4
9. [ ] Section 9: Let's Build a Framework / Library! 0 / 8
10. [ ] Section 10: BONUS Lectures 0 / 2
11. [ ] Section 11: BONUS: Getting Ready for ECMAScript 6 0 / 2
12. [ ] Section 12: Conclusion 0 / 1

Oh yeah, I'm giving up on [JavaScript30](http://javascript30.com) for now. I want to be able to do every project on my own. I can probably continue to do more of them, but I just don't have the time to invest right now. This is a challenge I will take in the future.

I have to focus on React.

## Started [Learning React](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

I bought the 37 hour Udemy course. Hoo, boy. Am I ready? Are you ready? Is the world ready? Let's do this.

To start, here's an overview of the course with my progress for the day.

1. [X] Section 1: Welcome 2 / 2
2. [X] Section 2: Setting up Your Environment 3 / 3
3. [ ] Section 3: Hello React 4 / 16
4. [ ] Section 4: React Components 0 / 17
5. [ ] Section 5: Stateless Functional Components 0 / 8
6. [ ] Section 6: Webpack 0 / 12
7. [ ] Section 7: Using a Third-Party Component 0 / 4
8. [ ] Section 8: Styling React 0 / 11
9. [ ] Section 9: React-Router 0 / 9
10. [ ] Section 10: Redux 0 / 15
11. [ ] Section 11: React with Redux 0 / 13
12. [ ] Section 12: Testing Your Application 0 / 17
13. [ ] Section 13: Deploying Your Apps 0 / 13
14. [ ] Section 14: Firebase 101 0 / 10
15. [ ] Section 15: Firebase with Redux 0 / 10
16. [ ] Section 16: Firebase Authentication 0 / 9
17. [ ] Section 17: Styling Expensify 0 / 12
18. [ ] Section 18: What Now?  0 / 6
19. [ ] Section 19: Upgrade Guides 0 / 1
20. [ ] Section 20: Free Mini-Courses 0 / 1

As you can probably tell, once we get to Section 13, it starts to become a little less relevant. At that point, I think I'm jumping back into [Colt Steele's course](http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp) to learn about authentication, deployment, Node, etc., etc.. So, hopefully these 37 hours are shorter than expected.

Also, I'm still not sure if I'm going to learn enough from this course or not. If so, [Tyler McGinnis](http://tylermcginnis.com) is still an option. My current thought was just that I'd check out his React bootcamp and go from there. If I feel like I need it, I'll sign up. Otherwise, the monthly payment plan sort of stresses me out. I'd prefer to pay one price (even if it's $100) rather than a monthly or yearly fee.

Anyway, today was mostly set-up. We got React & Babel installed. I started pretty late and had some other things come up. Tomorrow, we start writing real code. 

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Go through another few videos of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts. Then, continue to focus on React.
