**Coding Time:** Half Day

There's a common thread in the blogging world. You see a blogger lose interest, then return due to a short burst of inspiration, and then disappear completely again.

I assure that is not what happened here. I'm too far in to quit coding. The only question is if I continue to blog about coding. I think I'll always need to write about what I've been doing whether it's privately or publicly. 

In this case, I had a series of small hindrances that all added up to a 9 day snag. I'm fine now, thanks. I can't guarantee I'll be here every day until Monday, but after that -- It's attempt #2 at actually having nothing interrupt working 5-6 days in a row.

**Here's what I did today:**

## Got caught up on email

I wanted to say getting back to work after a period takes quite a bit of catchup. I've been moving quite slow just on a mental level so I just somehow spent hours on email.

## Fixed a [GitHub issue on the Alia app](https://github.com/rmorabia/alia/issues/1)

Someone was nice enough to look at my app and report an issue! It just proves that no matter how much I personally thought about edge cases, something comes in the way.

Fixing this didn't take too long. It was a nice exercise in getting my brain to think about programatically again.

As of the time of this writing, the app is working on Glitch, but not on GitHub? It might not work overall.

Also, I updated the [README](https://github.com/rmorabia/alia) into what I presume is the final form. I'll be using this as a model for my other GitHub READMEs. I'm excited to see them get more complex as I use React & Webpack.

## Read YDKJS for an hour

After I finish publishing this post, I'll go to read YDKJS until I fall asleep. This is mostly more brain exercise to get myself ready for tomorrow. I just started Chapter 2, so I'm officially into territory I didn't reach the first time I tried reading this.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Attempt Cool Pics again. If it isn't working in a reasonable amount of time (still!), move onto building the [color game](https://rmorabia.com/color-game/) in React.
