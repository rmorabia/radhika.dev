**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Learned Some JavaScript Design Patterns!](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/4-javascript-design-patterns-you-should-know)

A solid day spent and another thing checked off of the todo list.

Granted, I didn't use these in any of tiny projects, but I did take some notes and I understand the use case. I don't know whether I'll ever use these, but I at least understand the concep of "when in this use case, you should probably do this." I got it.

### The Factory (Method) Pattern

This was very confusing. It basically is just used to create objects in Object-Oriented Programming. It just gets rid of `new`. It's mostly useful in cases where objects need to change a lot. 

So, instead of:

```js
const Object = function(a) {
    this.a = a
}

Object.prototype.test = function () {
    console.log(this.a + 'test')
}

const okay = new Object('okay')
okay.a()
}
```

We would do the following:

```js
const Object = function(a) {
    const Object {}
    Object.a = a
    Object.test = function () {
        console.log(this.a + 'test')
    }
    return Object
}

const okay = Object('okay')
okay.a()
}
```

It's not that different, so I just really don't see the point. But, I get it now. Okay. That happened. 

### The Module Pattern

The module pattern uses scope to its advantage for safety reasons. It basically creates a space for private functionality where only some parts of that space can be accessed from the outside. This seems like the most useful pattern of the bunch.

Here's the basic syntax:

```js
var accessLater = (function () {
    var ok = 'ok'
    var notOk = 'not ok'
    return {
        ok = ok
    }
})()

var accessOk = accessLater.ok
```

So, you can only access `ok` because the return object specified that. Because `notOk` isn't specified, you can't access it outside. I got it. It's useful.

### The Prototype Pattern

This is used for creating objects when performance matters. I don't understand what the alternative to this would be? This seems like the normal way of doing things.

Here's what it's describing:

```js
var Okay = function () {
    this.o = 'o'
    this.k = 'k'
    this.a = 'a'
    this.y = 'y'
}
    
Okay.prototype.b = function () {
    console.log('b')
}
    
Okay.prototype.d = function () {
    console.log('d')
}
```
    
So, yeah. That's that.

### The Observer Pattern

Here's where things start to get fuzzy. I just can't fathom the use case for this. This is used so that when an object is modified, it broadcasts that a change has occurred to its dependent object. Who cares? I don't care? I don't care enough to write down the syntax. I think this was only included in the article because Angular?

### The Singleton Pattern

I don't understand this one. I mean, I do. But, the syntax was too long for me to grasp. It allows for a single object instance to be used globally. You can't make multiple objects with it.

An example use case would be making settings across an app. I'd imagine VS Code's Settings which are written in JavaScript follow this pattern.

I can just look more into it once I find a use case. 

## Bookmarked a lot of random stuff about Functional Programming

It's a big topic. It seems like a bigger topic than Object-Oriented Programming. I don't know how to handle this. 

Since this is the last thing to learn on my todo list, I'm now concerned it'll take more than one solid day of work.

I can go through a full-fledged course like the ones that [Frontend Masters](http://frontendmasters.com) has. Or, I can watch the playlist that [MPJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) has. Or, I can watch [this talk that serves as an introduction to the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY).

Or worse, I can read any number of books on the subject.

How far should I go? How will I know when enough is enough? I don't know. I'll start tomorrow and see how it goes. 

## Continued through [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understand-javascript)

I learned a lot today. 

Firstly, that thing called `.bind` I kept seeing everywhere but didn't understand? Yeah, I get it now.

It's a way to define where the `this` points to in any function.

Eg.

```js 
function whee () { console.log(this.okay) }.bind(window)
```

Now, bind creates a copy of that function and changes the context of this within it. This is useful for something I'll mention further down.

There are two alternatives to bind that I haven't seen before -- `.call()` and `.apply()`. 

`.call()` just executes the function then and there instead of creating a copy. `.apply()` is nearly the same as `.call()` except that it takes function parameters in the form of arrays.

So, this leads to another word I've heard quite a bit, but had no clue what it means. Currying.

You can use currying with `.bind()` to create a copy of a function (acting sorta like a template) and add preset variables to it. That's all currying is. It seems kind of like object-oriented programming, except with functions.

Eg. 

```js
function c(b, a) {
    console.log(b*a)
}

const c2 = c.bind(this, 2)

c2(2) // 4
```

Cool beans.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Learn about Functional Programming in JavaScript. Dive deep into it and spend one full day fully immersed in it. I really hope it's only one full day, and I get the gist enough to move on with my life.
