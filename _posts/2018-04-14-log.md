## Made a tiny change to [the website](http://rmorabia.com)

I've split the skills section into two rows -- "Langauges & Frameworks" and "Tools." I just like it a bit more padded out. Let me know if there's anything else you think I should add to it.

I also plan to split the `style.css` in a style for the index & a separate style for the blog. Soon.

I still have to fix the nav bar, too.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Finish learning about Webpack!
