**Coding Time:** 3 hours-ish

**Here's what I did today:**

### Continued to Learn the Command Line

I took a day off yesterday. I came back and suddenly this tutorial is trying to teach me vi(m). No, thank you. At this point, the tutorial is becoming too advanced for my own needs. I don't really need to learn vi(m) or bash scripting or efficiency practices. Not yet, at least. I'm still skimming through it and trying some of it out, but most of it is flying well over my head for lack of use.

The second half of [this tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial) got a lot heavier than the first. I am still not done. I've learned a lot, though, and will be posting all of my incoherent notes once I am actually finished with the book.


## Tomorrow's To-Do's

FINISH THIS COURSE!
