**Coding Time:** Full Day

I skipped the day forward to 80 because I probably did code for 15 days over the past month.

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Built a todo list in React](https://codesandbox.io/s/2zrpp5p0mj)

Over the last two days, I built my first full-fledged React app.

I've decided that to work on my making React second instinct, I should copy all of the apps I created in vanilla JS to React.

So, first on the list was the todo list. Then, I'll make [cool pics](http://rmorabia.com/coolpics) & end it off with the [color game](http://rmorabia.com/color-game). After that, we'll see. I may just go through some more generic projects (Pomodoro timer) if I still need more practice before moving on.

## Thought some more about my routine and the future

There's still so much I don't know about React. Namely, AJAX/Async/APIs again. But beyond that, the equivalent of YDKJS for React is just going through the official docs. It's basically a book. Maybe a page a day will keep the doctor away?

There's also [a bunch of talks on how React works interally](https://reactjs.org/community/videos.html) that are worth looking into.

I have to read YDKJS and all of these. I feel like I have to take these in small doses, but it's hard to add a little dose at the end of the day that isn't a video. Maybe if I stick to this new routine, I can start adding a few pages a day to my evening activities.

After I get comfortable with building projects, I'll move onto React Router, which is covered in the course.

After that, I think I want to move onto Node? I have [the rest of Colt's course](http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp) and then [Andrew Mead's Node.js course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/). I also want to slowly work my way through [Anthony Alicea's Node.js course](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/).

I went ahead and bought those two today since I know I'll be using them soon.

Then, once I'm comfortable in Node, I'll jump back into React and learn Redux.

The problem is -- I also want to learn deployment & testing in React before I move on to Node. So, I'm not sure what to do here. I hate skipping.

I may just finish the course and then look further into Redux ([with Wes Bos](http://learnredux.com)) if I need it.

Here's the outline of the React course again:

1. [X] Section 1: Welcome 2 / 2
2. [X] Section 2: Setting up Your Environment 3 / 3
3. [X] Section 3: Hello React 16 / 16
4. [X] Section 4: React Components 17 / 17
5. [X] Section 5: Stateless Functional Components 8 / 8
6. [X] Section 6: Webpack 12 / 12
7. [X] Section 7: Using a Third-Party Component 4 / 4
8. [X] Section 8: Styling React 11 / 11
9. [ ] Section 9: React-Router 0 / 9
10. [ ] Section 10: Redux 0 / 15
11. [ ] Section 11: React with Redux 0 / 13
12. [ ] Section 12: Testing Your Application 0 / 17
13. [ ] Section 13: Deploying Your Apps 0 / 13
14. [ ] Section 14: Firebase 101 0 / 10
15. [ ] Section 15: Firebase with Redux 0 / 10
16. [ ] Section 16: Firebase Authentication 0 / 9
17. [ ] Section 17: Styling Expensify 0 / 12
18. [ ] Section 18: What Now?  0 / 6
19. [ ] Section 19: Upgrade Guides 0 / 1
20. [ ] Section 20: Free Mini-Courses 0 / 1

So yeah, basically the plan is as follows:

1. Get comfortable with React by doing projects (~1 week)
2. Go through the rest of the React course (~2 weeks)
3. Do some more projects (~1 week)
4. Get started with Node & MongoDB (~1 month)
5. Build an advanced project with Node & React (~2 weeks)
6. Learn SQL (~1 week)

That puts the timeline at for being officially ready to apply for jobs at... somewhere around the begining of August. I think I mentioned that I wasted a bunch of time the past month and have officially postponed the deadline by a month. So, that's that.

## Thought about the side stuff I want to complete by August too

Somewhere along the way with that, here's my complete todo list for side projects:

1. Make a resume.
2. Fix website (responsive bar, errors)
3. Fix readmes for all projects (gifs, details for running)
4. Read You Don't Know JS
5. Read the React docs
6. Read the equivalent of YDKJS for Node
7. Maybe even redo the entire website to be prettier and stuff
8. Go through Command Line Power User to learn how `zsh` works
9. Go through [Stephen Grider's JavaScript Interview Course](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/)
10. Write React/JavaScript articles on Medium

I'm not sure how to deal with all of this. Some of these are one-off problems, some of these are long. What's the list like in order of priority?

1. Make a resume!!!
2. Fix the READMEs on your projects!!! People see those!
3. Add a responsive bar to the website!! It looks so unprofessional right now!
4. Read You Don't Know JS!!! It's required reading!
5. Go through the Stephen Grider course!!! Maybe it'll tell you magical secrets to life!!
6. Read the React docs! You'll never know what you don't know without them.
7. Read the equivalent of YDKJS for node!
8. Write articles! It could bring you job attention.
9. Redo the whole website.
10. Go through Command Line Power User.

Hmm, when I put it like that -- it seems like my Sundays should be committed to resume, readmes, and website work. 

Then, every evenig, I should spend an hour reading or watching videos.

Okay, let's organize this again. 

**Sunday Work:**

1. Make a resume!! (ASAP)
2. Fix the READMEs on your projects! (Gifs, features, installation instructions. Emulate Alia app.)
3. Add responsive bar to the website. 
4. Write articles for Medium about React and JavaScript.****
5. Add an articles component to the website.
6. Go through Command Line Power User.

Some of these are easy. Devote one Sunday to them, it'll get done.

The writing on the other hand? I'm not sure. I'm really mixed on whether or not it'll help me get a job or not. For now, I'm going to lean towards no and write no articles. There's no need to waste 6-8 hours on a heavy cognitive task I could also just spend learning or even applying for jobs.

**Evening Work:**

For an hour every evening, do one of the following, in order:

1. Read YDKJS.
2. Go through the Stephen Grider course.
3. Read the React docs.
4. Read the equivalent of YDKJS for Node, or just do Anthony Alicea's course.

It just all feels like so much and none of it feels like it really gets me any closer to getting a job. It's not like I can write "read all of YDKJS" on my resume.

Oh yeah, and I forgot I want to contribute to open source somewhere along the way, too.

Whatever. Follow the process. It'll all come eventually. Or not.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

So, first I have to spend the day working on replicating Cool Pics in React. This means I'll be working with APIs, which is something that is not exactly (sorta in the Firebase section?) covered in the Mead course. If I get lucky, I can finish this in a day. If not, it'll take two.

[This is probably a good place to start.](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html)

After that, I will spend an hour or so reading You Don't Know JS.

That should be enough for now.
