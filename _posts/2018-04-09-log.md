**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Watched Day 1 of [Tyler McGinnis' Free React Bootcamp](https://tylermcginnis.com/free-react-bootcamp/)

Well, this was a doozy. I had heard great things about Tyler McGinnis. I was even afraid that I'd have to take his course(s) after my Udemy course.

Tyler's preferred method of teaching is starting with the lower level, theoretical stuff, and then working his way up to higher level, practical stuff.

Nope. No thanks. I would not have understood a thing if I hadn't already gotten as far as I have in the Udemy course. Even then, the second we got to something I haven't covered already (props), I was left high & dry. My brain shut off and could only hear words.

This is a new motivation to go through enough of Andrew's course to be prepared for the rigor tomorrow. 

I did not like it, but it's at least interesting to have another perspective. And hey, its' live, so it doesn't take as much effort to push myself to attend.

The motivation from being confused from Tyler's course paid off.
