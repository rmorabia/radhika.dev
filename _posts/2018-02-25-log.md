**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued Learning Some Random Stuff in JavaScript

I got an intro to OOP that made zero sense at all. What is a constructor function? What is a class? How do I write this? WHO KNOWS?

I continued to slowly wade through JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts. Scope. I got it.

It just seems that every time I go to learn about a new topic, there's just such a deep rabbit hole that's ENTIRELY INAPPLICABLE TO MY CURRENT SCALE OF PROJECTS.

What have I learned so far that actually changes the way I write code? Well, the Module Pattern, although I don't know the use case. I learned some date & time nonsense that will help in my next project. I _can_ use the arrow function, although I don't like it so I won't. I am going to switch to let & const. 

That's it so far. I just don't know how much all of this cramming is going to actually help me. 

There's not enough real practice in these videos & articles. I could code along, sure, but maybe I'm just lazy... Maybe I just haven't seen a real ROI when I do that. I write about everything I learn here or I take notes on paper about it. I don't really have a problem with forgetting things as long as I see real use cases.

I want to code again!!!

## [Bought a new JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/?couponCode=YOUTUBE10)

Honestly, someone needs to stop me. This is my third Udemy course and I'm not even to the halfway point with the other two. But! This covers a lot of really good stuff and offers a lot of interesting side projects. Worth the 10 bucks? I think so. I think it should at least get me coding again without having aggressively hard-to-follow codealongs (looking at you, Wes). 

I know you can get everything for free -- especially with stuff like Udacity. But, I just don't like the disconnected theory. I like having one authoratitave voice I can trust and one fixed price rather than a monthly fee (like Treehouse).

This course covers:

* OOP (with a project)
* Async/AJAX & Fetch API
* ES6
* The 4 main Design Patterns

And has a few projects along the way.

It's 22 hours, so maybe this makes my timeline a litle longer than expected. I doubt I'm going to skip through the course much because so much of it is unknown to me. 

If this is enough, the only other thing I need to learn on my own is Functional Programming. Which is obvious -- [http://youtube.com/FunFunFunctions](FunFunFunctions). Done & done.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Basically, now my life is going to be flip-flopping between my 3 courses. 

1. JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
2. Modern JavaScript From the Beginning
3. JavaScript30

I don't know which order is the most prudent. I need to finish all 3 (and learn about FP!) before I can move on to react though.
