**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Started Learning [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

I've known HTML/CSS since I was 13. I learned by Googling what blocks I needed and filling the rest in along the way.

I didn't think I needed to read a book on the subject. This proves me wrong.

I've learned a lot just today -- There's CSS resets so that your CSS can look as similar as possible along every web browser. There's CSS semantics to ensure that you're using the right elements for the right structure. The most mind-blowing fact? There's CSS IDs and Classes so you can apply CSS to something more specific than the entire element. I vaguely knew about this, but only with `<div>`s.

I'm very excited to see where this book goes. We're building a website together in the book, which is a learning style I very much prefer. I like books that lead to an end project and walk you through it.

This book seems to focus on clean code right from the beginning. I took a lot of notes, but I wrote them on paper to just solidify them in head. I will be transcribing these onto the computer later, but for now, they sink in deeper on paper.

Today, I finished Sections 1 & 2 out of 12. (This doesn't include the Advanced course. I'm not sure if I'm going to be taking that or not.)

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Finish sections 3-6 of the HTML/CSS course. If I finished 2 in a half day, I can surely finish 4 in a full day.
