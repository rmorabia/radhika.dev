# Radhika Morabia's personal website

This is a static website with a few different components.

## Home Page

The index is coded by me, Radhika Morabia, with loads of help from the CSS frameowork [Spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

It's mobile-responsive and accessibility-friendly, so check it out in any browser you'd like!

## Blog

Within the home page, I host a blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I display it using the [Tale theme](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale/). Down the line, I hope to replace the Tale theme with my own code that is designed like the homepage.
