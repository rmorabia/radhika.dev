**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued working on the [React version of Cool Pics](http://github.com/rmorabia/coolpics/tree/react)

I don't know what to say about this. I finished everything except for the infinite scrolling, and then it just _wouldn't work_. I don't know how to fix this. I spent all day on it and I'm basically at the same place as I am where I started. None of the tools seem to work, React doesn't have any built-in components to deal with it, and I don't want to cheat and use vanilla JavaScript. I'm completely lost.

I might restart from scratch tomorrow. I really wish I had finished today, but I don't know... I tried.

## Read YDKJS for an hour

I can't write anything about this. I'm taking a break after publishing this so I can't actually confirm if this is going to happen right now. But I hope that later, when my brain calms down a bit from the failure, I'll read for an hour.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Finish Cool Pics. Continue reading YDKJS.

I also want to revamp the website's skill buttons to be color text on a white background. I'm not doing that tomorrow, but I wanted to mark that down somewhere.
