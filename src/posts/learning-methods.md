This post is a continuation of [How I Learn](https://radhika.dev/how-i-learn) and the [Top-Down Learning Cycle](https://radhika.dev/top-down-learning).

After going through a [list of things I wanted to learn](https://radhika.dev/planning-sept-2019/), we decided that I learn best by learning about a concept in some way and then build a small, stupid app to cover the ideas. We also learned what sorts of concepts I want to learn, with a clear direction about what to learn next from something I'm picking up at work.

We've covered the exposure stage (top-down) and the practice stage (build something stupid). We haven't yet covered how I best _learn_ about a new concept.

Let's start with a list of what definitely does not work:

## What Does Not Work

### Conference Talks

Whether they're in-person or online, conference talks tend to be way too hand-wavy and skip over the details that I really need in order to feel like I understand what I'm doing.

I need to be taken into the gritty details, just not too far that it starts wavering into theory. I need the how, and a bit of the why.

I like meetups (and I love lightning talks in-person), but conferences must definitely be for meeting folks, not for learning.

### YouTube-style exposure

Channels like [FunFunFunction](https://youtube.com/funfunfunction) feel like they're mixing leisure and learning in a way that I really do not like. It moves too fast to be split-screened with a code example, and doesn't go into enough depth for me to naturally internalize what's being talked about. Straight in one ear and out the other.

I have now unsubscribed from all programming channels on YouTube. I never watch them, anyway. They just sit in my Watch Later and start piling up.

### Code-along articles

I skim on computers. I read on my phone. Good articles read like books -- I can load them up on my phone and follow along. Code examples are meant to be read, not coded along to. Context switching between text and code leads me to a lot of copy-pasting. Line-by-line explanations after the code is already copied over are super hard to follow along with.

### Incremental Exercises

I can never stick with this long enough to see the usefulness. I hate isolated examples, in any form. They don't stick in my head. I need small examples, but in real contexts. Not isolated.

### Podcasts

Literally the worst way to learn. I hate 99% of all developer podcasts. Stay out of my ears.

## What Sometimes Works

### Fast-Paced Screencasts

This really depends on the topic. I will often default to [Egghead](https://egghead.io) when I want o learn an extremely specific skill. Examples include, "How do I use hooks?" and "How do I use styled-components?" These are like video versions of going through the documentation.

This only works for **specific tooling**. I would never do this for learning a new language or framework.

### Books

Books... Books... Books... I don't have a lot to say here. I'm trying to read a lot more this year. I haven't decided if I like this yet. I enjoyed reading [Clean Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) though, believe it or not. It's not a great book, but I enjoyed reading it.

Books are extremely good for **absorbing software engineering ideas.** I haven't tried textbooks for lower-level concepts yet. Books are **bad for learning new languages and frameworks**. Books are obviously terrible for specific tooling, since that requires up-to-date information.

I only read physical books. Any books that only exist in ebook formats must be worth the effort. The only book I've found that was worth the effort for me was [JavaScript Allong√©](https://leanpub.com/javascriptallongesix). This is a really strict filter.

### College-style Lectures

This is highly dependent on the lecturer and quality. I find that good lecture styles will use lots of examples that are easy to pause and follow along with. I don't watch at a higher speed, it probably takes me 2x as long as the lecture length.

### Docs

The ability to learn from docs is almost entirely dependent on the docs themselves. This is good for **tooling and frameworks.** This is not a good first introduction to a new language or paradigm.

### Just Diving In

It works... eventually. I don't prefer it. I like knowing the details of the implementaton. I can't just survive off of syntax.

## What Definitely Works

### Code-Along Videos

[Andrew Mead on Udemy is my favorite teacher in web development and I owe my career to him.](https://mead.io)

The quality here varies, but tends to live in its best form on Udemy. It's cheap, instructors are incentivized to take things slowly, and it's a low-risk way to get acquainted with a new instructor who you can then trust. I haven't found any instructors off of Udemy that I like more than Mead.

(I have other recommendations in this category if anyone is curious, just ask me.)

...

This post will most definitely be updated as I think about this more. This is mostly just a reminder to myself about what to avoid taking on other learning styles that don't suit my own just because I can or because other people say it works for them.

I learn in my own way, and that's okay.
