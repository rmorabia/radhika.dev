**Coding Time:** Half Day

Firstly, another apology for being in and out. I swear this is all temporary. It's a long temporray, I know. But, I'm in the middle of moving. This is all happening from the 11 inch Chromebook. There's just been so many major life changes.

**Here's what I did today:**

## Set up Vim for development

I added a lot of plugins today. It's nearly ready for full-scale development. I just need to add some remapping. I'm not the most comfortable with it yet, but do I believe I could use it full-time? Well, we'll see.

If I switch to the Chromebook full-time, this is basically the only option. The alternative is I get another Linux desktop & spend an extra $100 a month at the coworking space to have a dedicated desk. 

I really believe I can switch to Vim. It's just a matter of practice.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

I have a lot to do, and a lot of small updates.

1. I have to continue to set up the Chromebook & Vim as my main machine. There's only a few things left to do. This is going to be less productive for me for an unknown amount of time. I'm sure I can get used to it, though. 
2. I have to fix [issue #1](https://github.com/rmorabia/todo/issues/1) for the React branch of the todo list. I should also change React to the `master` branch and have that be the hosted code on the website.
3. Start the Weather app.

Let me talk a bit more about the Weather app...

I really couldn't finish Cool Pics. I don't know what to say about that. I faced a lot of mental resistance and I'll come back to it at some other point.

For now, I need practice using React in a bigger context. I need to actually use it to its full potential. I'm going to try go extra ambitious to get a medium-sized app going. It's going to have nested components split into multiple JS files just like we had in the React course. 


I don't know when I can actually start it, though. I feel extremely distracted these days. I don't know when work mode will actually be back. I need to get organized again, but I can't get organized until after the move.

Oh well.
