title: "Month in Review: February"
categories: review
---

I remember when I was writing the Monthly Review for January, I genuinely believed it couldn't get any worse. After all, I had overcome the biggest hurdle in my programming journey. I could officially make stuff!

Then, after the first few days in February, I made nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

Honestly, I may have forgotten how to code at this point.

This month didn't feel like a month. I know it's shorter than every other month, but not by enough to justify this feeling.

It's not even like I took a whole week off like the other months. (The end of the month looks like I did, but I just didn't have enough to write to justify a day.) I was thinking about code every day. I was at least trying to watch my videos and read my articles every day.

In some ways, this was my most consistent month in that sense. I had come closer to that goal of coding full-time. Yet, my hours logged are the least to date. My output is just abysmally low. 

At various points in the month, I wavered between, "I'm going to be ready for React next week!" and "Well, I guess I'll wave React goodbye until April."

It didn't hit me unti today that it was March 1st. The entire month passed. I have nothing to show for it. As of today, I am much more on the side that it'll take another month before I'm ready to move on from vanilla JavaScript.

Well, anyway. No use lamenting. Here's what happened this month.

This month, I spent **11 of 28 days learning to code**.

That's just wrong. It's true, but it's wrong.

The approximate amount of hours I spent coding is **73 hours**.

That's a whole 25% less than my (already low) average for the other months.

Again, this just feels wrong. It's true, but it's wrong. 

I'm not even going to calculate how much longer this is going to take me until I reach my coding hour goal. That was a nice metric at first, but now it's just silly.

This measurement method really undervalues the amount of time it takes for these complex topics to sink in. I can go through a maximum of an hour of [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understanding-javascript) a day before my brain just fries from all of this theoretical information.

But, I can admit I didn't spend that brain fried time practicing what I learned in small exercises. I just couldn't think of how without overwhelming myself with all of the theory and tactics I had learned. I had to learn everything first, and then I'd build again. 

This month was all wrong and I want to erase it from this blog. But, I can't erase it from my life or my timeline, so I can only hope I do better starting in March.

Still, let's go over the nitty gritty of what I actually did. 

## What I Wanted to Accomplish in February 

1. Color Game App
2. You Don’t Know JS: Up & Going
3. You Don’t Know JS: Scope & Closures
4. JavaScript30 (one video a day)
5. FreeCodeCamp’s Intermediate Front-End Projects
6. FreeCodeCamp’s sections on Object-Oriented & Functional Programming and on JSON APIs & AJAX
7. Udacity’s AJAX courses (Intro to AJAX, JavaScript Promises, and Asynchronous Requests)
8. JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
9. FreeCodeCamp’s Advanced Front-End Projects
10. BONUS: ES6 for Everyone - Wes Bos
11. BONUS: Udacity’s Object-Oriented Programming
12. My Pet Project in JavaScript!!!

Good try, kid. Honestly, it wasn't even a good try. 

## What I Actually Accomplished in February

### Finished that [Color Game](http://rmorabia.com/color-game)

Yeah, it's there. I did it.

### Also built a [todo list](http://rmorabia.com/todo)

I actually forgot that happened this month. It feels like a lifetime ago. This project was very sophisticated compared to the color game.

I still (sort of) like the code on it. I didn't make too many compromises. I would definitely refactor it to make it completely different, but that's only because I know a lot of things now that I didn't know then.

With the color game, the compromises I made were because I just couldn't do what I wanted to do. With the todo list, the changes I would make now are because I didn't know what I could do back then.

The todo list completely tore me apart. I haven't felt particularly positive about coding since. I've wanted to build again since that disappointment I felt in this todo list wore off, but I just haven't had the chance to.

### Learned about Scope & Closures

The [You Don't Know JS book series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) still scares me. I know they're good. I know they're not that hard to read. I know I should really, really read them before I get a job. I just can't.

Maybe I will later, maybe I won't. For now, I spent a few days watching random videos and reading random articles to understand scope & closures. 

Scope is under what circumstances a variable can be accessed. There's global and local scope. There's a sort of order of operations to JavaScript that I still don't exactly know to a tee, but I at least know it exists. I know that when my code goes wrong, it's probably a good idea to double check the scope of what's going wrong.

I also know it's good to limit scope, because things get complicated once projects get bigger and everyone is using `var i`. 

Closures are just functions nested within other functions. The inside function can access all the variables within the function above it, but the outside function can't access the variables in the inside function except when returned. 

I kind of get it, but there's nothing really life-changing about this concept. It's definitely going to change the way I write my code, but it's still very theoretical to me. I'm not a big fan of theoretical.

### Submitted [my first Pull Request](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/pull/798)

This was cool, if confusing.

I still don't know how I can contribute to open source projects. I see issues and I get scared. It doesn't matter what it is, I'm just very scared of doing it wrong. I can't imagine how to fix it. If all these other people who saw it can't fix it, how can I? 

I want to have a lot of nice open source contributions under my belt before I start applying to jobs, though. I actually want to add it as a section on my homepage with its own blog category so people can see all my pull requests. 

### Wrote a [little thing that went a little viral](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7yyb7g/6_tiny_project_ideas_to_go_from_i_know_the_basics/)

I still got it. 

I just hope it helped _someone_? The most recent comment is that someone livestreamed themselves going through the projects, which is really cool.

### Learned about higher-order functions & callback functions

Have you noticed just how wildly this list has diverted from the original list? The worst part about learning new things is just that you don't know what you don't know. 

I learned about higher-order functions and callback functions in theory, and I learned about higher-order functions in practice. 

I spent way too much time trying to understand the `Array.map`, `Array.sort` nonsense. I get it, but I still don't see how it can help me.

Higher-order functions generally feel like closures. I understand that I'll see my code in a different way now that I know about them, but I wish I had a real use case.

### Set up a [test branch of rmorabia.com with a secret test blog](https://github.com/rmorabia/rmorabia.github.io/tree/test)

This is a whole thing. I chose [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io) because it's much simpler than Jekyll, but it's still infinitely extendable.

Well, it turns out that comes with a cost. I can write my blog posts without the obscure restrictions Jekyll has, but I can't have the extensive tag and category support.

I think the ideal middle ground solution is just to deploy rmorabia.com on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). That way I can actually use Jekyll plug-ins, of which there are 1000. 

The only problem with this is that my side projects like [rmorabia.com/todo](http://rmorabia.com/todo) will be forced to be [rmorabia.github.io/todo](http://rmorabia.github.io/todo) unless I manually uploaded all of them to Netlify, which I don't want to do, either.

Right now, I think the priority is on the side projects more than my pretty tag clouds and stuff. We'll see what I do when my _real_ redesign comes. (After I get a job.)

There's still a lot of fixes I want to make to my current site, but that can all be done within Jekyll. The real fix may just be switching/removing my CSS framework. Or just removing the outlines when you click links. That'll go a long way to making the site look more professional.

I hate everything.

Oh, and this is a perfect time to note -- I went the whole month and still didn't fix Kevin's site. Sorry, Kevin. _Someday._

### Sorta went through [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understanding/javascript)

I don't know, man. This is so theoretical. Anthony talks kinda slow, but when I speed it up even a little bit, it's too fast. It's a good course, don't get me wrong. I actually really like it. It's fundamentally changed the way I look at JavaScript.

But, at the same time, I can't for the life of me get through it at any reasonable pace. 

As of February 28th, this is my progress on it.

1. [X] Section 1: Getting Started 5 / 5
2. [X] Section 2: Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments 13 / 13
3. [X] Section 3: Types and Operators 3 / 11
4. [ ] Section 4: Objects and Functions 0 / 23
5. [ ] Section 5: Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance 0 / 4
6. [ ] Section 6: Building Objects 0 / 8 
7. [ ] Section 7: Odds and Ends 0 / 4
8. [ ] Section 8: Examining Famous Frameworks and Libraries 0 / 4
9. [ ] Section 9: Let's Build a Framework / Library! 0 / 8
10. [ ] Section 10: BONUS Lectures 0 / 2
11. [ ] Section 11: BONUS: Getting Ready for ECMAScript 6 0 / 2
12. [ ] Section 12: Conclusion 0 / 1

Yes, I spent a whole month on it and I only got through 3 out of 12 sections. 

I can't justify this. I don't know what to say. I spent a lot of time trying to watch this. I also spent a lot of time clicking away mid video and getting lost in something else for hours.

I'm not giving up on this. I think it's worth it to 100% this course. I am committed to doing it, still. I just can't guarantee any sort of timeline on this. 

### Sorta went through [JavaScript30](http://javascript30.com)

Short videos, they said.

An hour a day, they said.

Good practice, they said.

I got through 5 of 31 of these. All month.

Every time I sat down to do one of these, it somehow ended up eating up my entire day.

I didn't get arrow functions, or Wes went too fast, or I just didn't care. 

I'm much less committed to completing this 100% right now. I have a list of the rest of the videos I want to go through on one of the blog posts. That's it. I can't be bothered to learn about more things that I don't find immediately applicable.

ESPECIALLY when it's not even theoretical/fundamental knowledge.

### Read some more about `this`

This list is going to start devolving into concepts I learned about only in theory.

I know what `this` does now. I still don't know all of the use cases. Cool.

### Learned some ES6 stuff

I use `let` & `const` now.

I know how to write an arrow function. I refuse to. I hate them.

I know about default parameters.

I keep forgetting what template literals are.

I know how to use classes in OOP, but I can't tell the difference between using a class or not.

### Learned some nonsense about Object-Oriented Programming

How is this applicable to any small project? I don't know!

I know what prototypes are, though. I know what prototypal inheritance is. I definitely know how to use `this` in objects. That's the easiest `this` case there is.

### Learned the module pattern

I still have to learn the other 3 main ones, though.


### [Bought a new course](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/learn/v4/?couponCode=YOUTUBE10)

Oh yeah. It turns out there was a course (with exercises and projects) hiding in Udemy that covered most everything I was trying to learn this month. It just so happened that I found it near the end of the month instead of near the beginning.

I really haven't started it yet. I don't know if it's any good. But, the only intermediate JS concept it's lacking is in Functional Programming. That's fine. Filling one theoretical thing on my own is a lot different than trying to learn everything from 100 different sources.  

### Started listening to programming podcasts

Due to life circumstances, I now have 7 hours a week to devote to podcasts. I already had podcasts of my own that I like to go through, but I don't think they fill 7 hours a week. I want to feel productive even though I'm not actually capable of doing anything in this time, so I thought programming podcasts would fill that void.

I'm still finalizing which ones I actually like, but here's the ones I'm pretty sure I'm sticking to right now:

* [JavaScript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber) -- weekly panel + guest talk about JavaScript things. Kinda technical, kinda hate it because it veers off into directions I just don't care about. 
* [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/podcast) -- I've only listened to one episode, but Saron seems to be a pretty good interviewier. 
* [Base.cs Podcast](https://www.codenewbie.org/basecs) -- From the creators of CodeNewbie. I'm hoping some CS knowledge will help me in interviews and just with general understanding.
* [Take Up Code](https://www.takeupcode.com/podcast/) -- This is also another CS in small bytes (FUNNY!) podcast.
* [FreeCodeCamp Podcast](https://freecodecamp.libsyn.com/) -- This is just read-aloud versions of the greatest hits on their Medium blog
* [The React Podcast](https://www.spreaker.com/show/the-react-podcast) -- Brand new! The creators are going to try to sell their own React courses and whatever, so this had better be good.

Those are the ones I'm committed to right now. Including the archives, it does fill up my 7 hours a week. But, there's a few hours that are on the maybe list. I just haven't listened to a full episode yet so I can't say they're out or in.

I also downloaded a bunch of interviews on other podcasts with developers I follow. I really have way too much now. 

## What I Didn't Get to Accomplish

See, when I write it out, it does seem like a lot more than the hours say. 

I still think I could've done a lot better. I especially could've coded a lot more. Even small exercises would've been better than this completely dry spell. Everything I learned is in my head or on paper notes. There's been zero application since the todo list.

Beyond just "I should've coded more!", there's a lot of concepts I didn't get to cram into my brain. The list of concepts got longer and longer every day.

Learning what to learn ate up a lot of my energy, hence why this list is so long.

1. JS: The Weird Parts -- I should've at least gotten through Section 4 by this point. I'm not even halfway done with the course.
2. JavaScript30 -- Same here, I should've at least been halfway done. 
3. Async/AJAX/APIs -- I still have no clue how any of this works. I have now confirmed they are all actually related, which is nice. But this is a topic that I'm afraid to start since it seems like it can go on forever.
4. The 3 other Design Patterns
5. Functional Programming -- There's a lot more easily accessible media about FP, so I went to OOP first. This shouldn't be too hard now that I have the open space.
6. I should've at least started the new course. I've had it for a few days now.
7. Even STARTING any of FCC's intermediate projects! Prioritizing these other concepts above APIs was a mistake. APIs are much more actionable. 

That's about it. It's messy. It's just a disappointing level of output. 

## What I Want to Accomplish in March

The actual output is starting to matter less and less to me. The ability to show up and actually sit down and work at least 5 days in a row without having any problems that cut me short is becoming a much bigger issue. That's not something I'm going to talk about here, though. 

My goals for March are pretty simple.

1. 100% JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
2. Finish however much of JavaScript30 I want to finish until I FEEL finished
3. Go through Modern JavaScript From the Beginning
4. Learn about Functional Programming
5. Code at least 3 projects, regardless of the source (FCC, my brain, a codealong I choose to skip from a course)

That's it. If I can finish that, I'll be good.

**BONUS STUFF THAT'LL MAKE ME FEEL GOOD IF IT HAPPENS:**

1. Clearing through the articles I've accumulated on these topics I've been trying to learn this month. I have a lot in my Instapaper that are just so ignored.
2. Watching more of [The Coding Train](http://youtube.com/shiffman) <3
3. Maybe finishing all of this enough to start learning React?
4. Actually fixing Kevin's and my websites!

That's all for now. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to [email me](http://rmorabia.com/#contact). Podcast recommendations, things-to-learn recommendations, actually being a functional human being suggestions -- everything's welcome.

Thanks for reading. See you next month.
