**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http//udemy.com/understand-javascript)

We continued to talk about Object Oriented JavaScript again. Today, we covered pure prototypal inheritance. This is using `Object.create()`. It's less awkward than constructor functions, `new`, etc.. It's more natural. I understood it instantly. I don't see why we have to use `Class`, `new`, and all this other inherited-from-Java nonsense. It doesn't make sense to me.

I think I have 3 days left. Woo. Getting there.
