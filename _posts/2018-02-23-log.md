**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Created a new [rmorabia.com branch](https://github.com/rmorabia/rmorabia.github.io/tree/test)

Some days you wake up and you're itching to work on your website. Today was one of those days. I decided to find the static site generator for me. After many many tries, it's [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io). 

It's nearly-plain JavaScript, infinitely extendable, and doesn't include anything super complicated. I'm not sure I like the build process (all pages and posts just show up in individual folders without rhyme or reason), but if it works, it works.

So far, what I have is an almost working skeleton of the site. The index works as normal, the log shows a plain HTML list of all the posts, and there's no page for the indvidual articles yet.

What's left is making those two pages and adding in further functionality from more plug-ins. RSS feeds, syntax highlighting, a working tag system (!!!), etc..

This is setting up for my site to be infinitely extendable. I will also be moving the hosting over to Netlify.

Netlify is great, but I'm concerned that if I host the main site with Netlify, all of my projects being hosted on Github Pages with 2 clicks will go away. I want all my projects in their own separate repositories that run easily. 

I don't plan to continue working on this immediately. I'm just keeping it as another side project.

I still need to rebuild Kevin's site, too! Maintaining websites is such a timesuck. 

## [Finished learning about Array.map & all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWoZ9_ECZxQ)

Here's my understanding of the main 4...

`Array.map()` is like forEach.

`Array.reduce()` has two values, an accumulator and a value. You use this if you want to do something with that accumulator. Eg. Return the sum of all of the numbers in the array.

`Array.filter()` gets certain items from an array.

`Array.sort()` sorts the existing array in a certain way.

So... Yeah. Still not immediately useful, but I understand them now. That seriously took way too long.

I was watching The Coding Train's livestreams before. Big mistake. I get lost when he gets lost. From now on, skip all livestreams unless I'm actually watching them live. Stick to the edited lessons. 

## Learned some other various things in JavaScript

There's no direct source for this, but along this short journey of just surveying various tools, I learned more about ES6 & arrow functions. I feel like I know enough about that for now.

I should probbly still learn about promises & classes, though.

I also learned about prototypes in JavaScript. They're just a special function that exists in everything in JavaScript. You can add your own. I don't see how it's useful. I guess it's a framework thing. 

I read a bit more about `this`, too. I still don't really get it/see the point except in objects (refers to the object itself) or event listeners (refers to the event). Good enough? Good enough.

## Finished Day 5 of [JavaScript30](http://javascript30.com)

Cool. Flexbox. Easy. Done & done.

I've decided to skip through these a lot faster than before. It's absurd how much of my life getting stuck on Day 4 lost me.

This is taking up too much of my time and is even less directly useful than learning more about FP/OOP, so here's a list of the rest of the videos I plan to go through:

* Video 6: Ajax Type Ahead
* Video 7: Array Cardio Day 2
* Video 12: Key Sequence Detection
* Video 13: Slide in on Scroll
* Video 22: Follow Along Links
* Video 24: Sticky Nav
* Video 29: Countdown Clock
* Video 30: Whack a Mole Game

Those are just the ones that seem interesting to me. I may even skip if those just don't seem useful. Maximum one a day.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I feel like all of this theory I'm learning is really just getting in the way. I'm hitting my limit with vanilla JavaScript unless I actually wanted to dig deep into it and skip frameworks entirely.

I feel ready for React.

This doesn't mean I'm starting tomorrow, but I'm starting very soon. Sooner than I originally thought. Maybe one/two more weeks as long as I keep a steady pace.

Here's an exact list of what I need to finish before I start React:

1. As much of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts as I can. I don't mind having this bleed over into learning React and taking it slow.
2. Learning about AJAX/APIs/Async. Enough to understand the concept and use them in the 2 projects I want to do. This is the longest part left.
3. JavaScript Main 4 Design Patterns.
4. ES6: Just an intro to Promises & Classes. Also watch all of TheCodingTrain & FunFunFunctions' videos about ES6. 
5. Functional Programming: Watch & vaguely understand the FunFunFunctions' playlist about it. 
6. Object-Oriented Programming: Watch a few playlists/videos & read a few articles about it and vaguely understand it.
7. The videos I listed above in JS30. I don't mind this bleeding into React either.

Then, I need to make 2 projects. One of the 4 intermediate JS projects in FreeCodeCamp and my "When is Alia Bhatt's next movie coming out?" app. Maybe build more if I want to. Maybe build the Advanced FCC projects before moving on to React.

That's it. As long as I stick to a good schedule, I should be done with the learning within a week and it should take another week to get through the projects.

That would still bleed into March, but I was originally worried that this list would last all of February AND March! If I hadn't lost so many days in February, I would've definitely finished all of this completely on schedule.
