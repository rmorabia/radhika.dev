**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued [Learning React](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

I'm really starting to get into the groove of this. The first sections were such a braindump of new information, and they were so long, there was no way I could get through a section a day.

Now, though, I can see progress very easily and I'm really starting to understand React.

Reminder that my bare minimum to "know" React and start building apps is at the end of Section 8. Router, Redux, authentication, testing, deployment, and integration with a backend can come later. There's no use learning it when I haven't even built a todo list.

So, really, I'm nearly there with actually starting to build stuff again! Just Webpack, styling, and third-party components left.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

I didn't get to Tyler's next livestream because I wanted to finish Section 7 by the time I got there. So, continuing my goal of one section a day, it'll still be a few days until I get there. That's fine.
