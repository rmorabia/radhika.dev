**Coding Time:** 5 hours-ish

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued to Learn the Command Line

Sometimes, a resource doesn't click with you. Sometimes, *two resources in a row* don't click with you. I finally zeroed in on [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php). I'm about halfway done with it. I will finish tomorrow.

I expect this will be a problem in the future, but hopefully not to the same extent. I have a few lists of curated resources I'm following. I plan to pull all my future learning from there. None had any courses on the CLI, which I knew I wanted to master, so that's why this is taking so long.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I will finish the command line. I may start on Git.
