**Coding Time:** Half Day

First, I'd like to say I didn't take a break from coding these past few days. I just kept trying and getting absolutely nowhere. So, today is basically just an update for the past few days. 

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued through [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understanding-javascript)

That's seriously about it. I have nothing else to say here.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

You know the drill. 3 courses + learning about Functional Programming + actually making some side projects again. Soon.

I just need to learn how to balance it all better.
