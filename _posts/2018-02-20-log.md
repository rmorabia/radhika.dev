**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Submitted that article to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7yyb7g/6_tiny_project_ideas_to_go_from_i_know_the_basics/)

Gimme that viral fame, internetz! 

Again, there's no real benefit to me writing that, and I hope I never try to write something like that again. There's no point. Stick to code, girl.

## Made a small change to [the index](http://rmorabia.com)

It turns out that the sliding bars that I had before might not be the best way to present my skills. It's pretty, but it's vague.

If you're reading this, go to [rmorabia.com](http://rmorabia.com) and tell me what you think about my change. I think it looks very bare now, but I feel like there's little I can do to spruce it up. The colors are already my attempt to make it fancy.

I thought about different charts, but I think they'd all show me in a bad light. I think the only alternative is still displaying the skills in a linear fashion like that, but just with a bit more pizzazz. 

## [Learned more about higher-order functions, array.map, etc..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWoZ9_ECZxQ)

Higher-order functions are kind of like closures in that they're fancy versions of normal functions. But, higher order functions either take a function as a parameter or return a function. So, that's cool? I don't understand the usage except in existing higher-order functions, but the more you know.

`Array.map()` is a glorified for/forEach loop. Which... okay... I at least know how it works now. The only difference is that it only works if it returns 

So, the problem from JavaScript30 is as follows:

> Array.prototype.map()
> 2. Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names

So, the code is pretty simple. 

```js
let map = inventors.map(function (inventors) { 
    return inventors.first + ' ' + inventors.last
})

console.log(map)
```

The only part I'm kinda confused about is why it needs the parameter? But, it's still just a case of understanding the syntax.

We also learned about `Array.filter`, but I just really can't see a use for this right now. I'm going to watch the video on filter & sort tomorrow, as well, but other than the JS30 exercises, I can't see how this is useful in real projects. 

By the way! I linked to a new resource today. This is The Coding Train on YouTube. There's actually some good tutorials on YouTube. 

This is a really cool channel. It's very teacher-like. I feel like I'm in a classroom with a very animated and very good teacher again. The only problem is that since it's teacher-like, many of the videos are just to explore programming art and physics. It's not directly applicable.

But, for topics I really don't understand, if Dan's already done a video on it (which he probably has), it's a great way to spend a few hours and let it really sink in. 

Any other YouTube channels I can recommend? Right now, just [FunFunFunction](http://youtube.com/funfunfunction). That's about it. 

I really need a minimum energy level in a video to stay engaged. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Really didn't accomplish much today considering the amount of hours my butt was in this chair. I just felt too floaty today to really focus on code.

Watch the 2nd livestream from The Coding Train which covers the other Array methods.

Continue going through JS30 & JS: The Weird Parts.
