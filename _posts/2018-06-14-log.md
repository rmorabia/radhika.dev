**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Worked a bit on [Chingu](http://chingu.io)

I didn't get too far with this today. I have a lot of todos left here.

- Get familiar with React Router
- Make the rest of the wireframes
- Review the code & folder set up for the client side

Tomorrow, first thing in the morning.

## Started [Andrew Mead's Node.js Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2)

I spent a bit of time debating whether to do Colt's course or Andrew's course. I'm just not that big of a fan of Colt's style other than for looking at project ideas and for getting wide overviews per lesson. 

I think Node.js will be easier to learn since I know React, and React will be easier to learn since I'm starting to learn Node. Today, we mostly covered the very basics, which are very helpful in understanding what's going on with our Chingu app. I hope to have both Node & React somewhat mastered by the time we're done with the Chingu app (early August).

Here's the course overview & my progress so far, as always:

1. Section 1: Welcome 1 / 1
1. Section 2: Getting Setup 6 / 6
1. Section 3: Node.js Fundamentals (Note App) 6 / 17
1. Section 4: Asynchronous Node.js (Weather App) 0 / 16
1. Section 5: Web Servers and Application Deployment 0 / 10
1. Section 6: Testing Your Applications 0 / 9
1. Section 7: MongoDB, Mongoose, and REST APIs (Todo API) 0 / 28
1. Section 8: Security and Authentication 0 / 18
1. Section 9: Real-Time Web Apps with Socket.io 0 / 24
1. Section 10: Async/Await - Just Added! 0 / 6
1. Section 11: Free Mini-Courses 0 / 1

Looks like most of the course is relevant, which is interesting to see after a lot of the sections in the React course just seem shrug-worthy. 

As always, my minimum goal is an hour's worth of videos a day, and my stretch goal is a section a day. That seems very unlikely with some of these sections going into the videos in the 20s. We'll be here a while, folks. 

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

First of all, work on Chingu.

Then, once those tasks are done, devote all my energy to learning Node.

And of course, continue to get comfortable with the new working environment in regards to moving and productivity.
