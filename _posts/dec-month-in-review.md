I just finished my first month learning to code! Happy new year, by the way.

This month, I spent **15 of 31 days coding**.

The approximate amount of hours I spent coding is **95 hours**.

That's definitely an underestimation of the amount of hours my butt was in the chair. I don't think I'm effective enough at learning just yet to count every hour I spent in my chair as an hour coding. 

My goal is to code for 1000 hours before I start applying for jobs. 

At this rate, it'll take me **9 more before I'm ready**. 

Oof. Here's hoping I do better next month.

## What I Wanted to Accomplish This Month

I know I took it easy this month. A lot of my time was spent getting used to my new contacts, finalizing a learning plan, and most importantly, **learning how to learn again**. 

These are very intangible goals that aren't related to coding, but that will help me out more in the long term. I made progress on all 3, but I'm nowhere close to perfect yet.

On the actual coding front, though, here's what I wanted to accomplish:

* Build Kevin's Website
* Build My Website
* Learn the Command Line
* Finish CS50x
* Learn HTML/CSS
* Build my portfolio (FCC Project)
* Learn Git
* Learn Flexbox
* Learn Sass
* (BONUS) Learn CSS Grid

Here's how I actually fared on all of those goals:

### [Build Kevin's Website](http://kevinacarson.org)

I did it! It took an embarrassing amount of time to rebuild a website after years being away from static deployment, but I did it to make the next time easier. Nothing special here.

### [Build My Website](http://rmorabia.com/log)

I wanted to get a website up as fast as possible so I could start my daily log. It took me a long time to finalize which static site generator would fit my needs. I ended up going with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

I didn't *want* to go with Jekyll. It's slow, and more than that, I just find Ruby to be a really awkward language to set up and work with. 

But, I learned Jekyll in 2014. It has an `index.html` that just does whatever you ask it to. Every other static site generator had an `index.html` that was hard to find and customize. If I could change the `index.html`, I couldn't figure out a way to have a subdomain be my blog.

Jekyll just worked -- albeit after Ruby did the exact opposite of that. 

I may change to Hugo/Hexo/Metalsmith down the line. For now, I just don't know enough about how they work.

### Learn the Command Line

This was my first real test in learning how to learn again. I had to choose between something accessible and something that went into detail. I went back and forth for days.

When I did finalize which [guide I was going to follow](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/), I found it dense and hard to follow for more than a few lessons at a time. 

This took forever. I started on [Day 2](http://rmorabia.com/2017/12/10/log) and finished on [Day 7](http://rmorabia.com/2017/12/16/log). This was something that should've taken a day... two at most. 

That was probably the hardest thing I had to learn so far, for reasons entirely on my end.

### Finish [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

I tried the first week. It seemed fun, but it seemed like it would take several hours I just couldn't afford right now. If I went through it, it would take me a solid month. That's a month I could be learning something directly useful, like JavaScript.

I will go through this eventually. I just don't have the time right now. For now, it's postponed.

### Learn [HTML/CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com)

This was the next major thing to learn after the Command Line. This also took forever, but for different reasons than the Command Line.

This book was legitimately long (just wait until you get to the JavaScript books, Radhika!) and I was really solidifying my learning practices.

I ended up with a process I hope to emulate in all the future books give me enough space to do so.

There were basically two sections per chapter. One was the reading/learning section. The other was the "In Practice" session where we sit at the computer and learn to code.

I'm REALLY bad at reading on the computer. I don't know if I'll get better over time or if I'm just doomed forever. I don't know if I can actually become a good programmer if I'm doomed forever. I just can't handle reading long, techical texts on a backlit screen.

So, I got the book on Kindle. I would sit in bed and read the first sections on my Kindle, taking notes on paper.

Then, once we got to "In Practice," I would move to the computer and go through that there. I would also transcribe the notes. 

I'd go back and forth every day.

I also ran into problems with giving myself the task of "Get through as much of the book as you can in one day." It led to me getting through less than one section per day.

So, I went off of my progress for the first day and just set the goal for 2 sections per day. The entire book had 12. 

This wasn't the most ambitious goal I could've set, but it was definitely attainable and possible. I reached it almost every day, no matter what time I started and what time I ended. The consistency paid off a lot more than possibly binging 4 sections a day instead of 2. 

Overall, this took me 6 days to read through.

### [Build My Portfolio](http://rmorabia.com) (FCC Project)

This was really cool! By the end of the HTML/CSS book, I was itching to code again. I had designed my website a few times before, but it'd always been very simple. Of course, when I designed them, I thought they were the most difficult things in the world.

[This challenge was from FreeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage) It has a few requirements and has an example website for you to base your website on.

I based my website on the standards set by FCC & [this portfolio template](bmorelli25.github.io/portfolio-template/).

Extra challenge? Make it mobile-responsive, accessibility-friendly, AND have readable code.

Somehow, I did it all within the span of 2 days. There was a lot of Googling, a lot of copy/pasting random answers from StackOverflow just to see if something would stick. 

But, I got it done faster than expected and it includes a lot of complicated elements I'm very proud of.

* The intro is both horizantally and vertically aligned to whatever your screen size is.
* The button in the intro that links to the Skills doesn't seem that special, but man, that was a lot of work.
* Both the skills and the project sections are extra mobile-responsive, changing the grid layout depending on what the width of your screen is.

I will continue to make small iterations on the website as I learn more and more.

### [Learn Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

Easy peasy. I've been using Git & GitHub since 2014. I went through a book to solidify it and learned a few new things. I did it on the side with extra time I had after reading the HTML/CSS book. 

### Learn [Flexbox](http://flexbox.io)

This was my first video course! It was decent. I still haven't decided if I like books or video courses better. 

I haven't had much chance to practice Flexbox. I hope to just master it as I go.

### Learn [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

First, I had to learn that it's "Sass," not "SASS." I sound like an old person yelling, "GET ME ON THE FACEBOOK."

### BONUS: Learn [CSS Grid](https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE)

I technically could've fit this one in, but I was really squeezing too much grid learning in during the last few days. I was afraid I'd just get them confused if I learned them right next to each other, so for now, learning CSS grid is postponed.

**How many goals did I accomplish this month? 8/9, and I didn't complete the bonus**

Not bad for my first month! I feel pretty good about this, but it is the easiest month of them all. 

Next month, I'll begin learning JavaScript.

## Early Estimates for January

Without really knowing enough to judge how long this will take, this is how much I'd get through in an ideal world:

* You Don't Know JS: Up & Going
* You Don't Know JS: Scope & Closures
* You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes
* You Don't Know JS: Types and Grammar
* Project: FCC Algorithm Challenges (Basic)
* BONUS: Dom Manipulation
* Project: Make a todo list webapp

Will I get through all this? I have no idea.

Tune in next month, and every day in the meantime, to find out.
