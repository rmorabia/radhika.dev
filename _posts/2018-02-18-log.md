**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Submitted my [first Pull Request](https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/pull/798)

This was just a quickie for [CodeBuddies](http://codebuddies.org), which is the main platform I hang out on. It just involves some really small CSS changes. Easy enough.

Still took me a few hours since the site is run on Meteor and I don't understand how Meteor works. I've also never really run around a large Git repository like that. I messed up my first commit, so I just reverted it and pretended it never happened, but Git knows... Git always knows...

This was good practice, though. I want to have a section on my website like [Projects](http://rmorabia.com/#projects) that lists out my Open Source contributions before I get to interviews.

"Not only have I built my own silly apps, I have contributed to other people's less silly apps!"

## Finished Day 4 of [JavaScript30](http://github.com/rmorabia/JavaScript30)

Well, this sure ramped the difficulty up.

This was my first exposure to array methods. 

They seem pretty hard. I just need a few exercises to solidify the syntax and use cases. My head hurts, I feel tired, this was a case of learning overload.

I believe all of the basic algorithm exercises on FreeCodeCamp are based on these. So, I'll probably get a chance to get better soon enough. 

## Continued Watching [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/)

I watched like... one video? This wasn't my best day.

## Wrote an Article

I guess old habits die hard. I'm not going to link it because I plan on publishing it, but I wrote an article called "How to Go From Knowing the Basics of JavaScript To Actually Building Websites."

The basic concept is just putting [tinyjs](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs) into words.

It's around 1000 words and I spent hours editing it today. Why? Who knows? 

I don't know why I waste my time like this. CODE!!!

I'm going to go through a sleep-on-it edit and then try to submit it to FreeCodeCamp. Wish me luck, I guess?

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Continue going through JS30 & JS: Understanding The Weird Parts.

Maybe get something real done for once?
