**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

### [Continued to Learn the Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)

I really don't want to turn into a book learner. I don't believe you need to go through a book 100% to get going, get started, and get to making real things. Making things teaches you a lot more than just going through a book and doing examples. The further I get into this book, the more I feel like I should skim faster and faster.

So today, I skimmed through **Section 10: Grep and Regular Expressions**. I can see where this becomes useful in debugging large files, sometime down the line. However, I won't be debugging in the command line. I'll be debugging in my text editor of choice. (Currently, that's Atom, but I really haven't decided.) I have one line of notes from this:

```
* egrep is the command for regular expressions, which can help you find data that matches a particular pattern
```

If Grep is relevant within my IDE/text editor, I'll learn it within the confines of that particular editor. It's probably more graphical and has specific quirks.

Next up? **Section 11: Piping and Redirection.**

Here are my notes from the very useful section:

```
* [command] > [location] will save a log of the output from that command
	* '>>' to add the output to an existing file instead of > replacing it
	* use 2 (stream 2: error stream) to write errors to log. eg. ls video.mpg 2> errors.txt
		* to do both, &1. eg. ls -l video.mpeg vi3 > myoutput 2>&1
* < to redirect FROM a file, eg. wc -l < myoutput
	* still not sure how this is useful but whatever
* piping | splice multiple programs together. the output from the first command is the input for the second program. it can run forever. eg. ls | head -2
```

There are only 2.5 sections left. I expect to finish this within a day or two.


### Continued [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

Today, I started on Week 1 of the course. I think I'm sticking with it.

I watched the lecture, which 2 hours and 10 minutes long. It was dense. I feel the muscles in my thighs going numb from sitting for so long. It covered a lot in one day, without breaks for implementation. This covers my fundamental problem with university-style learning &/or video learning at large. I wanted to stop when David covered "Hello world" in C. I wanted to stop and try that code for myself. Before I could, he moved onto math. Then, he moved onto real-world problems with binary overflow. I couldn't stop at all. Technically, I could've because it's an online video with the Pause button, but I didn't feel like that was at all a recommended action.

It's a really interesting introduction to *Computer Science*, though. It's not just about code, it's about understanding why the code works that should serve as a fundamental block for any area of coding that the student would later go into. I think I'll invest a bit more time into it even though it feels slightly wasteful because of the broad application.

There's no way I could finish the assignments for this week in one day, though. You have to create 4 coding projects which all build off of each other. This course is way more like iterative project learning with supplemental videos rather than videos with supplemental Problem Sets/homework. I don't know if I'm a fan of that or not.

We are supposed to code all of our projects in the online IDE C9, which I'm not sure I'm a fan of. It's slower than working in Atom/any local IDE. My computer & my wifi aren't very fast, so that extra RAM/bandwidth being eaten by working in a computer in the browser isn't the most ideal situation. It's also not the best way to develop independent coding skills. Regardless, I don't want to cause problems between the automatic grading system and my local code, so I'll learn C9.
