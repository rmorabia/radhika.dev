**Coding Time:** Full Day


**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I quickly finished the last few chapters. I'm glad to be done with that. I think I already had a good understanding of Git since I've been using it for years now, but the book introduced me to some workflows that I hadn't thought of as a single contributor who mostly just uses GitHub.


## Finished [My Portfolio Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

Wow, I finished it in one day. Including the two other half-days I spent on it, **this website basically took me 2 days to finish**. I even re-read the code before deploying it to make sure it was readable.

I'm not sure if I should write a blog post about my decisions and problems in making the website, or if a demo and a source code is enough project proof.

As a quick summary for my future self, the biggest struggle was everything relating to the button link in the intro that goes to skills. I struggled with centering it, having it be an icon that is a link, and having it link to the proper spot that wouldn't cover up the Skills headline. 

I may write a complete project write-up tomorrow. I'm not sure. For now, I'm just glad to be done.


## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I wanted to read the SASS guide & watch the Flexbox videos in the time I still had after finishing my website, but my wifi went down, so I suppose it was the universe telling me I deserve a break.

Tomorrow is the last day of December! It's also hopefully the last day I work on HTML & CSS. I have to read the SASS guide and get through as much of the Flexbox course as I can. I don't know how long it is, so I'm not sure I can finish it in one day. If I can't, my CSS studies will overflow into the time I allocated for JavaScript. Oh well.

I'll also be writing a Month in Review tomorrow.
