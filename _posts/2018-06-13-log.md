**Coding Time:** Half Day

We now return to our semi-regularly scheduled programming. 

**Here's what I did today:**

## Worked on [Chingu](http://chingu.io)

I'm not going to give a day-by-day update about what we're doing here. I'll just be noting when I worked on it and maybe list some general things I've done.

Yesterday, I set up Webpack for our team (apparently I'm the resident expert on Webpack) & I made my first wireframe in a non-paper context. It went okay. 

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

I decided to drop React for now and focus on Node. I'm doing this for market reasons. It's easier to say "Hey, I know frontend and backend, just throw your framework of choice at me) more than "Hey, I know frontend and this framework, I can learn backend for you???"

I'll pick React up later.
