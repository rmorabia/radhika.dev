Normally, this line would be a time tracker. I haven't installed one yet. I will soon. I'm still adjusting to Ubuntu.

Anyway, **here's what I did today:**

### Built this website!

After finishing [Kevin's website](http://kevinacarson.org), I decided it was time to put my own up. I've had a vague idea of what I wanted to do with it for a while.

As of right now, the plan is to have a static homepage that describes who I am and what I do. Maybe it'll link to some projects down the line.

Within that, though, I'll have a daily code log. I'm going to try to make some sort of coding progress every day. That can be direct coding, reading something, or just making my development environment better. All the code I write will be posted here & on GitHub. 

If I ever solve something through an absurd amount of Googling, I will probably write a tutorial on it. If I write enough of these, I'll have a new tutorials category for the blog and link that separately from the coding log. 

I moved around between [Hexo](http://hexo.io), [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for days. As a future JavaScript expert, I'd prefer to work with a JavaScript generator. When I downloaded Hexo and initiated my site, I found the layout completely foreign. Making custom pages (especially a custom homepage) seemed nearly impossible. It might just be my lack of familiarity.

I then tried Hugo since that's what I built Kevin's website in. Completely foreign, again. So, I gave in and installed Jekyll. I had custom built my website in 2014 using Jekyll, so it couldn't be that foreign. It really wasn't. There's a lot of quirks to Jekyll that are very annoying and have caused a lot of people to move to Hugo, but for now, I don't care. I apparently don't know enough about code to know how to change an `index.html` without completely destroying a site.

In Jekyll, the `index.html` is right in the root, and the variables(?) are written in a much more human way than with Hugo or Hexo. I may export to Hexo down the line, but for now, this is working.

Jekyll does, however, have one major catch. **Ruby is a nightmare on Ubuntu.** It's much harder to install properly than either Go or Node.js. There are people who say otherwise, but I doubt they're brand new to the language. I had major issues with installing Ruby, Jekyll, Bundler. `jekyll serve` was completely broken at multiple points.

I ran multiple reinstalls, followed all the StackOverflow advice, and finally Googled this fateful term: "Why is Ruby so hard on Ubuntu?" That led to a StackOverflow answer that linked to [this blog post](http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you). I followed each step completely. Everything works perfectly. It's almost magical.

Now, both the front-end and the back-end of my site are set-up and presumably futureproof.
