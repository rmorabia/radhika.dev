**Coding Time:** Full Day


**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued Learning [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

I finished Sections 9 & 10 out of 12. If everything goes right tomorrow, I'll finally be done with this book!

Here are my notes for Sections 9 & 10:

```
## forms

* form wraps around input elements, like a section element
	* action (attribute) tells the website where to dump the info
	* method (attribute) tells the website how to dump the info
* specific form elements are (usually) `<input>`s
	* common type (attribute) are text
		* others include password, color, email, date, range, search, tel, url
	* name (attribute) names what the input is
* `<input>` for one line, `<textarea>` is for a paragraph
* submit button = `<input type="submit">`
	* alternatively, `<button>`
*  `<input type="hidden">` for hidden stuff like tracking codes
*  `<input type="file">` for file upload
*  form `<label>` can be inline or its own thing on top of an input
    * `for="input ID"` (attribute, add the ID attribute yourself on the inpput)
* `<fieldset>` group relevant inputs together
	* `<legend>` tell users what this fieldset is supposed to do
* placeholder (attribute within input) for grayed out text inside form element
	* placeholder is grayed out while value puts the text in for the user
* required (attribute) won't submit form without an input
	* this will automatically validate if the type is correct (eg. email)
```

## Continued [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I went up to Lesson 44 of 53. One more day for this book as well! 

Here are my notes from today:

```
* rebase v merge
	* rebase keeps the commits linear and doesn't show the merge, it pulls the commits from the other branch
	* merge has one commit, the merge commit
	* rebase for local stuff, merge for most public/work stuff
* `git clone [old repository] [new clone folder` to clone the folder and the files in it and the git instance itself 
 	* will only clone the current branch
			* `git branch -a`(ll) will show all branches, including remote branches that are not cloned but in the remote repository
* `git fetch` will fetch new commits, will not merge the changes
	* to merge after fetching, do `git merge [remote repository branch]`
```


## Continued Building [My Portfolio Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

First of all, on a sheer design note, I changed About to Skills. I just don't know what to put in About. Everything you need to know about me is in the first 2 lines of the website.

Anyway, today I accomplished the following:

###  Fully completed the Nav Bar & Intro sections

The little things I left over from yesterday ended up being a lot. It took forever to find out how to make a nav bar sit on top of everything else and even longer to find a compromise on the button that goes to skills.

Adding the icons to the buttons in the intro was very easy, though. I also did quite a bit of designing to make the intro scaled and readable. 

It's fully done. 2/7 fully done.

### 99% fully completed the Skills section

I had to learn how grids work for this. It took a while to accept that I had to work within the confines of the framework. After I realized that, it took 15 minutes to fix this as I wanted. (Weirdly, the same process occurred for the down button in the intro section.)

It'd seriously take an extra forever to do this without a framework. I still feel like I'm cheating for using one since Spectre makes the bars, buttons, nav bar, and even cards for you. It's practically a copy, paste, and edit fest. Oh well.

### Set out a bare framework for the rest of the site

I just copy/pasted some elements to work off of for the next few days very quickly as my vision was blurring from working for so long.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Read the last 2 lessons of the HTML/CSS book & the last 10 lessons of the Git book.

For the website, here's what's left:

- Choose and add a font for the entire body
- Edit the experience timeline (the writing in this is going to be much harder than the coding, I'm telling you now)
- Set up 6 Projects cards in a responsive grid
- Finish the contact form, possibly adding a grid to have an aside that says "I hate social media!" 
- Create the footer

Will I finish tomorrow? Probably not. Will I finish by the New Year? Maybe.
