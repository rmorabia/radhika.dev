**Coding Time:** Full day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Started a YouTube channel???](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKJoUdr9igc)

Why do I always do this?

Why do I always start something when I clearly don't need the extra pressure?

I don't know.

But today, I made a little test video for a YouTube channel. You can click on the link above and see it for yourself. It's unedited, obviously. But, I trust you can ignore my stumbles and stil see what a general idea of the final product is going to be like.

So, let's talk about this.

Let's talk about the why, the what, the how, and the when.

First of all, why? Why would I subject myself to more work when I should be spending every waking hour learning?

I don't know.

I hate the state of coding education right now.

I don't care whether it's free or paid videos. I've watched a lot of YouTube videos, bought 4 Udemy courses, and I may buy a more expensive course (like a $100 [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com) course) once I move onto frameworks.

It's all just the same type of people making the same type of content.

Most coding education is an abstract introduction to a topic that uses dummy examples, followed by codealongs which assume you really understood what was being talked about before.

For example, something like: A function is a set of instructions for the code to initiate! Followed by immediately making an app with a function in it that explains none of the code in the function. 

From the extreme shallow end to the extreme deep end in a matter of seconds.

And it all happens with just another boring person with a nearly monotone voice who happens to be white and male 99% of the time. 

There's exceptions to this rule, of course. I love [MPJ](http://youtube.com/funfunfunction) and [The Coding Train](http://youtube.com/shiffman). I *like* [Colt Steele](http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp), [Gordon Zhu](http://practicaljavascript.com), and [Anthony Alicea](http://udemy.com/understand-javascript).

Before I move onto why I want to do things differently than these 5 that I like, why video? 

I think much better work is being done in the book & blog worlds. There's excellent content being written every day. 

The problem is, I believe that a good video explains in 5 minutes what would take 15 to read. The multisensory nature of it just lends itself much better to emulating having someone there in the room with you.

You can watch someone writing code and hear their thought process all at the same time. In a book, you'd see the code snippet either before or after the text and then read the explanation for the code before or after. It feels disconnected compared to a video.

I know videos aren't the best for everyone, but they're the best for me. 

So, what's lacking in all the other resources?

1. People who aren't men
2. Engaging voices
3. Practical content
4. Clear explanations
5. Beginner-focused tutorials
6. TOO SMALL FONT SIZES!

So, basically, what I'm saying is I want a channel where a woman with the energy of MPJ or The Coding Train explained things as clearly as Gordon Zhu and walked through real projects like Colt Steele. 

Just a friendly place where people with more alternative backgrounds can feel welcome and excited. I love the vibe that The Coding Train gives off, I just hate that it's all using these art frameworks.

I've been chewing on this for a few months now. Every day, I write about how I went through this and struggled through that as I slog my way forward down this path.

There's no one in the world that fills this void for me. I've looked.

So, why don't I fill it? 

I have a nice little valley girl accent, I know what I want out of the content, I have an online education and marketing background.

I can do it, but does that mean I should?

I don't know.

It's such a time commitment. I'd hate to either have too few or too many subscribers. 

I used to have a self-help blog once upon a yesterday and I continued to get caught up in the numbers game.

Schedules stress me out.

And I've already just go so much on my plate, including writing on this blog every single night. It's 2AM and I'm falling asleep as I write this, but I have to get this out there before I head to bed so I don't forget what I did today.

Hell, I don't even have a job yet! Who am I to start teaching programming?

So, as I said, I'd been sitting on this idea for months now. Today, the itch was a little stronger than usual.

So, I asked everyone. Both my programming & non-progrmaming friends. Every single person said it was a good idea. I hate all of them for saying that, but I concluded there was no harm in trying. 

I just recorded a little test video today. I have to record the audio on my phone and the video on my computer for the best quality without buying a dedicated USB microphone. If I end up actually doing this, I probably will just to save myself from the trouble.

So, I just thought, I'll record a video where I just walk through how to code my [tinyjs](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs) app #1. I'll explain every line of code and try to make it as accessible as possible.

I upped my font size in VS Code, set up the environment, and went for it. I tried my best to talk at a moderate pace while still remaining friendly and engaging.

I don't know if it's just the product of having a bad mic or not, but listening to myself after, I think I sound generic. I think the entire video comes across as just another Javascript tutorial. I want to be engaging like The Coding Train, where people just can't click away because I exude an energy and passion that is contagious.

And I just don't have it.

I don't know if it's just the mic, or if that comes with practice, or if it's because I don't want to do a facecam, or if it's just something inherently wrong with the structure I chose for my videos to be like.

Why am I even doing this again? I don't know!

So, the current plan is to just still get feedback on this test video. Is it good enough that it fills a void in the world that you would like seen? Is it clear, engaging, and friendly enough to make me a real personality? Is it actionable, useful, and practical? Yes to all 3? Okay, then I'll continue.

If this test video proves to be a success, then I'll record 20 ready-for-production videos in advance before I officially "launch" the channel. If I can commit to that amount, then I'm ready for the commitment. 

Also, when I "launch" the channel, I have to have at least 50 ideas for videos lined up. Right now, I feel like I cap out at 10. This is clearly not sustainable. If I can't reach that amount, then I should just give up while I'm ahead.

If I actually end up launching the channel, here's the plan --

I REALLY need a better profile picture than my dog picture before I start this. Soon. It's just never the right day to take a new picture.

I will still write here every day. That will not replace this. This is personal, that's public. 

I will upload 3 10-20 minute videos a week (preferably record all on the same day, queueing in advance). They should need very light editing. I need to practice more to get to the point where I don't need editing other than a quick trimming off the beginning & end. Editing is hell and I don't like it.

I will crosslink them all with Twitter (I somehow convinced twitter to give me [@RadhikaMorabia](http://twitter.com/RadhikaMorabia) back. I don't plan to use it actively, but if someone @s me, I will see it and respond. 

I will commit to this for 3 months (or 36 videos). If I don't like it for any reason after that, I can give up. No time before then. I can give up for any reason -- too much time commitment, too litle growth, no personal fulfillment. It doesn't matter. It's my perogative.

After that, who knows?

My goal is just to have 1,000 subscribers as soon as possible. That'd be a really cool number I'd be happy with. I know it's a bit ambitious, but I'm just not going to be satisfied with 100-200. 

That's it.

I don't know. Email me. Talk me out of this. Please. I have so many regrets. 

This is incoherent because I was typing this at 2AM. I may rehash my ideas on the topic some other day.

## Continued [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understand-javascript)

Got through 3 videos of this.

I finally finished this 17 minute video on IIFEs I've been struggling to get through for actual weeks. 

This course is still absurdly hard to get through and I'm convinced I'll never finish it. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Continue down the vanilla JavaScript todo list in any way I can. Please, Radhika. We need to move on from this eventually.
