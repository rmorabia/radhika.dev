**Coding Time:** Full Day


**Here's what I did today:**

### Continued Learning [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

I finished Sections 7 & 8 out of 12. We covered background colors & lists. The wide application in the earlier lessons is moving into specific scenarios. Some are a little obscure and I found myself skimming (why do I care about the specific styling of a relay gradient when I can just Google it), but then the book popped out at me with another widly applicable concept again. 

Here are my notes for Sections 7 & 8:

```
* function url("...") to href like html
* you can add background colors & images to specific elements, not just the whole page
* gradients exist. transparent text on a gradient background, whaaaaaa
 * order menu in unordered list rather than just anchors stacked on top of each other
```

That's it? Yes. A lot of big ideas & possibilities rather than specific rules as we go on.

## Continued [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I went up to Lesson 34 of 53. I'm not sure how applicable this is without pushing. My time from committing to pushing is virtually nil. I suppose this doesn't apply when I'm in a future team environment. 

Here are my notes from today:

```
* `git checkout -b [branch]` to create a new branch
```

Maybe today was just a day of few notes? Wow.

## Started Building [My Portfolio Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

This is the first project in [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org). Using raw HTML & CSS, you build a portfolio website that looks like [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/YqLyXB). I don't know about your design preferences, but that's the ugliest thing I've ever seen. So, I'm making this harder on myself and I'm going to try emulating [this](https://bmorelli25.github.io/portfolio-template/).

The second site is written in pure HTML/CSS, so I should already know everything I need to. I've built websites before. I have a pretty steady grasp of HTML & CSS, especially with the design & clean code concepts I've been learning with the HTML/CSS book.

Here are the project requirements, outlined by FCC and paraphrased by me:

* Access all content just by scrolling (single-page website)
* Social media buttons that lead somewhere
* Mobile responsive
* Thumbnails of different projects
* Navigate to different sections just by clicking on the links in the navigation bar

I'm going to be making a single page website with a floating navigation bar that links to About, Resume, Projects, BLOG (this is in all caps because it's going to have a different background), and Contact. All of those will be different sections below the start that just says, "Hi, I'm Radhika Morabia." in large, capitalized letters with the obvious exception of BLOG, which for now will continue having the Jekyll theme that won't match my homepage at all anymore.

I have the design all mocked up on paper, but I run into problems I've never encountered before immediately. How do I make a navigation bar float? How do I get one of those cool top sections that fill out the size of the screen? Should I code it to be mobile responsive on my own or use a framework like [Pure](http://purecss.io) to make my life easier? I don't know the answers to any of these.

So, the obvious solution is to break the project up into small pieces. Work on it from top to bottom day by day. It's really not that hard once I isolate which questions I have for my best friend, Google. It's just a little different than anything I've written before. 

First -- Should I use a framework or not? It sort of throws away everything I learned about CSS to do so. 

I built my first website using a CSS framework. I didn't know enough about CSS to wield it properly, though. It ended up being quite counter-productive.

However, I now know how CSS works. This means I can **read and customize** a framework to fit my needs. While younger me had to work within the limitations of a CSS framework, an older me can make the framework run to my will.

At the end of the day, I think the core tenet is this -- *I am not a designer. CSS frameworks design for you.* I want my website to be pretty, and it's going to take a lot longer to make it pretty using my own minimalist brain.

I did some research and found [Spectre](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/), which seems to be heavier on the design than Pure, but still lightweight. Perfect for me.

As so happens with all new technologies, it took a lot of troubleshooting to make it work, but I successfully uses SASS & Gulp (both technologies I'm entirely unfamiliar with and which required some dangerous node.js reinstalls) to change the default color of all the CSS from purple to a nice green.

Apparently SASS makes it easy to change defaults in a variety of categories, so I may end up using this quite a bit before the end of this.

Here's what I accomplished within the realms of actually building the website, with a lot of StackOverflow-ing:

### Nav bar floats, and is split between left and right

The left and right split came with the framework. To float the header, you just use `position: fixed`. Of course. 

### Intro takes up the entire space that the screen provides

This took forever to figure out. I don't know if it was because of some default CSS from the framework or if the header came in the way. I couldn't get the intro to fit the size of the screen AND center vertically/horizantally AND show the next content below. I still don't really understand why it worked with the code I ended up using.

For the HTML, I needed an outer box (the div to take over the whole screen) and an inner box (with the content that needed to be centered). This makes sense.

```html
        <section id="intro">
            <div id="center-intro">
            </div>
        </section>
```

For the CSS, I needed to make the `intro` box take up the entire screen. There were multiple ways of doing this, but nothing I tried seemed to be compatible with centering text.

Apparently there's an easier solution with Flexbox, but I don't know how that works yet and it never worked despite my troubleshooting like SASS did.

```css
#intro {
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
  }
```

For the actual centering of the text, this is where I start to get confused. It reads okay in theory, but it still doesn't make sense. I tried playing around with it to understand it, and somehow every line is needed to center the text vertically and horizantally. I don't know why.

```css
  #center-intro {
    position: relative;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    float: left;
    text-align: center;
  }
```

I also used IDs instead of classes for this. I thought it might've been a cascading issue. It might've been. Who knows? Better safe than sorry.

**[Here is the StackOverflow answer that helped me solve this.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5703632/3491301)**

It's 2:30 AM as I'm finishing this up. I love troubleshooting, and I could stay up forever just finding solutions to fixing the site, but I should sleep.

It feels really good to be coding again, even if it's static. I'm not a theoretical thinker, I'm the type of person who writes/codes with an end in mind. It feels good to have an end in mind again. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Read another 2 lessons of the HTML/CSS book & another 10 lessons of the Git book.

For the website,there are a few things I have to do to officially complete the Navigation bar and the Introduction section.

- Make the button background on Log a different color
- Test all the links to make sure they are working
- Add icons to the three links
- Add a ^ (but down) from the intro to About at the bottom of the section

Then, I'll be done with the first 2 of 7 seven sections on the website. The remaining sections are: About, Resume, Projects, Contact, and the Footer.

Will they be as hard as the Intro? Part of me thinks no since there's less fancy CSS involved. At the same time, who knows? Who ever knows?
