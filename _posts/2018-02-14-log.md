**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished Day 1 of [JavaScript30](http://github.com/rmorabia/JavaScript30)
This actually ended up taking like 30 minutes once I came at it without being exhausted.

I looked at Day 2, though, and I have NO idea how to do it. I may cheat and code along, tomorrow.

## Started Watching [JavaScript: Understandin the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/)

The first real video in this covered 3 large, vague words. I got scared. I'll continue, eventually.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Continue going through JS30 & JS: The Weird Parts. 

If I get time, maybe research some more ES6 essentials to integrate into the rest of JS30?
