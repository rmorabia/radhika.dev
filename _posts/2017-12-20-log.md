**Coding Time:** Full Day

I know I took a few days off here. I was working, or at least trying to work, but I didn't end up accomplishing much, so I didn't think it was worth remarking upon. In particular, I was experimenting with learning styles, which I won't go into here. Regardless...

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued Learning [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

I finished Sections 3 & 4 out of 12. This continues to be a very solid groundwork of design concepts in CSS/HTML rather than just a book that throws terms at you.

Here are my notes for every section thus far:

```
## html basic terminology

* element is the h in <'h'>
* tag is the entire <h'>
* attribute are inside a tag like class/src. eg. <a 'href=" "'>
* class can make css for all of the elements with this attribute eg. html: <p class="awesome" and <div class="awesome". css: .awesome { color: green; }
* id is like class but it can only be applied to one element eg. html: <p id="rmo" css: #rmo { ... }

## css basic terminology

* selector designates exactly which element the styles apply to. eg . p { ... }
* properties are what will be applied to the elected element. eg. p { color: }
* value is what you put into the properties, what actually happens eg. p { color:green; }

 ## css basics

* css resets make all browsers have the same fundamental style that you can then build off of.
* css stylesheets run from top to bottom, so the bottom is going to happen first.
* when naming class/ID names, choose a name that covers the content of the elements, not the appearance
* Comments: /* hi * /
* class/ID selectors take priority over the css cascade. they have weight. heaviest to lightest: ID, Class, Type(p, div)
* make css colors semi-transparent with RGBA (instead of hex colors) within 0 and 1. eg. background: rgba(128, 0, 0, .25) (last part)
* for most colors, use hex. if you need transparency, use rgba ^
* change display properties to be block/inline/inline-block to have the element displayed in different ways.
* display: none makes the element INVISIBLE. easter eggs galore
* margin is in the outside of an element's border, padding is on the inside of an element's border
* margin/padding shorthand: specifiy all 4 directions in one value. in order of top, right, bottom, and left. eg. margin: 10px 20px 0 15px;
	* longhand is padding-top or margin-left, one at a time
* vendor prefix for some selectors is used to support older browsers. eg. -moz-, -ms-, -webkit-
* box-sizing to handle width of each "box" in the css. in most cases, use border-box. this will absorb padding & border, but NOT margin. eg. p { box-sizing: border-box; }
* star * is the universal selector. * :before and * :after also exist
* auto value (in margin) equals it out between both sides if there's already a set width

 ## html basics

 * two kinds of elements:
	 * block-level: whole line is taken up, like p
	 * inline-level: within a block, like a link
 * comments: <!-- hi -->
 * there are 6 levels of heading. use heading FOR headings, not to make text big or bold.
 * tags with semantic importance:
	 * <strong is used to give strong importance to text
	 * <b is used to styllistically offset text
	 * <em is used to emphasize text/stress text
	 * <i is used to display an alternative voice or tone, like quotation marks
 * do not write special characters as the special characters. encode them.
 * to link to the same page, just add an ID to the particular part you want to link to. then, link to that id. eg. <p id="top" and <a href="#top"
 * put multiple classes in one element as long as there is a space between them eg. <a class="yo yo2 yo3"
```

Quite a bit of it is not in proper syntax since Markdown recognizes HTML and thinks I actually want to bold or italicize my notes. I know what the proper syntax is for these, I just had to write them in a readable way for the notes.

## Started [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I went up to Lesson 13 of 53. These are short, miniature lessons to get you familiarized with the various commands that Git offers. I expect to finish this pretty quickly.

Here are my notes from today:

```
* git status -- check status of working folder vs git repository
* git log -- view a history of commits
* git checkout [hash] returns your local file to an earlier commit like magic or git checkout master returns your file to the latest commit
```

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Continue with both the HTML/CSS course and the Git course. I can't start JavaScript until I finish these, so hopefully I get through them quicker with the updated learning methodologies.
