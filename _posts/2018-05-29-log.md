**Coding Time:** 2 Hours

**Here's what I did today:**

## Worked on [Cool Pics](http://github.com/rmorabia/coolpics/tree/react)

Just wanted to drop a quick note to say I did work on this today. Specifically, I worked on it on the Chromebook, which is a whole other topic. I feel better about getting this to work -- I at one point got it to fire a console.log every time the browser scrolled. I'm not sure what happened that made me lose that, but it at least happened. If not, Google "react infinite scroll tutorial" is more useful than I thought. I don't know why I didn't look that up earlier.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Attempt Cool Pics again. Continue reading YDKJS.
