**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Started Building [Thing #6](http://rmorabia.com/color-game)

I decided to take a pretty huge leap and go from building small components in tinyjs to a full-page app that deserves its own Github repository.

This project is a code-along from [The Web Developer Bootcamp](http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp), but I'm choosing to tackle it all on my own.

The end result should look something like [this](https://codepen.io/DanBonehill/full/VejYRz).

It feels so big. It took me a few days to even reach the point where I was comfortable writing down the requirements for the project. They're not very clear, but here they are:

1. Generate an RGB color randomly and convert it into text form.
2. Convert that text form into a block of color.
3. Display 6 random blocks of color.
4. One of those 6 is the same color as the top text form of that color.
5. That spot always changes to a random one of the 6.
6. Click on a color that doesn't match: color block turns black
7. Click on the right color: All 6 + background turn to that color
8. Difficulty toggle: Easy has 3 blocks, Hard has 6
9. When choosing the wrong anwer, a try again message appears
10. Site is mobile-responsive

The core functionality is only in the first 7 requirements. After that, it's just styling. I can focus on that later. 

I got requirements 1 & 2 fairly easily. However, when it came to displaying 6 random blocks of color, I knew I could do it randomly with 6 different functions that all align to 6 different element IDs. But, that just isn't clean and it won't work with the later portions of the requirements. 

I think I need to start with requirement #3. I need to somehow use arrays or objects to have one function apply to 6 different things. I don't really know enough about arrays and objects to do this, so this is a great excuse to actually go back and review the JS Basics part of the bootcamp!

...

I got to the point where it displays 6 random colors and there's a string output of one of the colors of the 6. This means I mainly just have all the clicking logic left. 

1. Click on a color that doesn't match: that one turns black
2. Click on one that does match: all 6 colors go to that color

& then the styling/different modes. Meh on that part.

I think the hard part is done, and I can hopefully easily do the rest tomorrow. I set down a good foundation today that I can build on tomorrow. 

## Continued Watching [The Web Developer Bootcamp](http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

I went back and rushed through Intro to JavaScript, then skipped forward to the sections on Arrays & Objects.

I didn't get very far until I remembered all I needed to about Arrays, so I didn't even fully finish the first video of that section. Oh well. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Finish the Color Game Project!
