**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished Day 2 & 3 of [JavaScript30](http://github.com/rmorabia/JavaScript30)

The second project was definitely not something I could accomplish on my own. I just didn't have a handle on the CSS, let alone the JavaScript. We used transitions, transforms, and dates. I at least tried to formulate an idea of how I would do it before I went and watched the video. I knew it had something to do with `setInterval`. So hey, that's something.

I coded the second hand along with the video and then did the rest myself. The problem with practically copying and pasting code is that the syntax is very hard to follow. I spent 10 minutes trying to figure out where my code went wrong. It turns out, I forgot to put parentheses on the inbuilt functions like `getSeconds`. 

That was cool to know, but still feels very out of my comfort zone. Anything really visual, any precise cloning seems difficult. I still don't think I can mock up Facebook or Twitter or anything in pure CSS, let alone the JavaScript. 

By the time I got to the third project, I started to realize that I don't think JavaScript30 is as advertised. This project is about CSS variables, which are a generally new thing that people don't know about. So, if I was expected to build the end project -- It's even less probable that I would already know how to than the second project.

At this point, I'm just going to treat this like a "30 random things you didn't know you could do in JavaScript" course. I don't know how useful that actually is, but it's at least worth seeing more possibilities for what you can do with just a few lines of JavaScript.

This also makes it more likely I'll get through more of these in a day. Maybe 2-3 per day from now on. 

## Continued Watching [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/)

I got through most of Section 2 today. This isn't a particularly long course, especially since so much of it so so theory-based.

However, it feels bad to binge it. I feel like I need to let it sink in after a few videos.

Regardless, just like I did for The Web Developer Bootcamp, I want to map out my progress. There's a lot of new terminology and it almost feels like we're dissecting JavaScript like a science class would.

1. [X] Section 1: Getting Started 5 / 5
2. [ ] Section 2: Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments 10 / 13
3. [ ] Section 3: Types and Operators 0 / 11
4. [ ] Section 4: Objects and Functions 0 / 23
5. [ ] Section 5: Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance 0 / 4
6. [ ] Section 6: Building Objects 0 / 8 
7. [ ] Section 7: Odds and Ends 0 / 4
8. [ ] Section 8: Examining Famous Frameworks and Libraries 0 / 4
9. [ ] Section 9: Let's Build a Framework / Library! 0 / 8
10. [ ] Section 10: BONUS Lectures 0 / 2
11. [ ] Section 11: BONUS: Getting Ready for ECMAScript 6 0 / 2
12. [ ] Section 12: Conclusion 0 / 1

I really only care about getting through Section 7. I'm not that interested in jQuery or how jQuery works, so we'll see when we get there. I'm hoping to cover around 4-6 videos a day, so my liberal estimate of a perfect record would be finishing this in about 12 more days.

I'm also hoping this will cover some other stuff I have to research for me, like Object-Oriented Programming. Kill all the birds I can with one stone.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Continue going through JS30 & JS: Understanding The Weird Parts. 

It's time to start covering more ground and doing these with the other courses/topics that I want to cover before finishing up with JavaScript.

I should probably either start the AJAX course or read about ES6 tomorrow. 

The list for the rest of JavaScript really isn't that long. These 2 courses are pretty long, but they can bleed into project creation. The only "learning" parts of the rest of the path that I'm particularly afraid of are the OOP & FP. They just feel like such big topics that could possibly go on forever. I really need to find one authorative resource that I can just finish, and feel finished with them. 

So far, here's my thoughts on authoritative resources for each of the topics I need to cover:

1. Scope & Closure -- JS: Understanding the Weird Parts (aka, I should've taken this earlier)
2. AJAX -- Intro to AJAX on Udacity (Does this cover how to actually use JSON/APIs, too? I don't know.)
3. Design Patterns -- JavaScript Design Patterns on Udacity (Or maybe I can just spend an hour on YouTube)
4. ES6 -- ES6 for Everyone (It's like 8 hours, overkill much?)
5. Object-Oriented Programming -- Object-Oriented Programming in Udacity (This is also like 8 hours)
6. Functional Programming -- FunFunFunction's Functional Programming Playlist (This isn't a formal resource, but it's the only one I found!)

There's a case to be made both ways -- just reading/watching stuff about the basics OR taking full-fledged courses and really having it dig into my soul. 

I don't know what the answer is for each. Other than the JS30 & The Weird Parts, none of these are required courses anymore. 

I can take a day and watch a few videos/read a few articles/make a few small experiments in Glitch, or I can take a few days and go through a video course.

I think that my methodology should be that if it's a short formal course like the AJAX (should take 2 days), start there. If it's a long (and expensive!) course like ES6 for Everyone, start informally.

For something longer like ES6 for Everyone, I learned the ENTIRE first module from one FunFunFunctions video. This really seems like overkill. 

I just wish I could download knowledge into my brain directly. Choosing the right resource is seriously the hardest part of all of this, and choosing wrong just leads to so much more wasted time than researching my options.
