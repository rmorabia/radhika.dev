**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Worked on Rmorabia.com

I have now made the entire site have a similar look & feel. Goodbye, Jekyll themes! Hello, custom design!

Everything *should* be working with these choice exceptions:

1. My JavaScript responsive nav isn't happening just yet. I tried reading the code for it and it was like reading German.
1. Footer is high on pages where the content doesn't at least fit the screen. Haven't found a fix for this yet. I don't know if I ever will.


## Tomorrow's To-Do's

So, going to spend a few minutes on the footer (and full disclosure, I may just give up) and then...

I have to find a book to continue with for JavaScript! Watch and Code was excellent for introducing concepts. However, for applying those concepts, I really need to go at my own speed. This is book speed. So, I'm going to spend all day browsing through books to try and see if any are based on building tiny projects, one after another.
