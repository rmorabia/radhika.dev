**Coding Time:** Half Day


**Here's what I did today:**

## Learned [Flexbox](http://flexbox.io)

One of the hardest parts about learning something new is choosing the right resource to learn it from. The guide I was following had two recommendations -- a video course and an interative game thing that's basically like Codecademy. My wifi was not helping me progress with either one.

I tried looking at alternatives to both and none went in enough detail in a short enough timeline. I could read a whole book about Flexbox or just suck it up and slowly get through the Flexbox videos. I preferred the videos this time.

I actually learned enough about Flexbox to actually simplify my website! I'd seen code about Flexbox being used to vertically and horizantally center content. When I copy & pasted, it didn't work for me. So, I went with some other weird CSS code I did not understand at all.

So, I changed my website's code with Flexbox's `justify-content` property. The code is just a few lines shorter, but it's definitely easiser to read.

On a meta level, I went through a video course today and it didn't suck! It took FOREVER (videos are only 2.5 hours long, I was somehow at it for 6 hours), but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Is it faster or slower than books? I don't know. It's hard either way.

Here are my notes for Flexbox:

# CSS Grids

* You probably never want to lay out a grid with normal CSS anymore. Use a framework, Flexbox, or CSS grid depending on the situation.
* Flexbox is usually for smaller scale grid layouts and content centering, while CSS Grid is for large scale layouts.

## Flexbox

```
* change display tag to flex for parent element of the sections you want to grid. eg. `<section` around three different articles.
	* this will automatically do every column equally, it's magical and will work for many situations but is NOT mobile responsive
* `flex direction` is default set to row, but can also be changed to column
* to make flexbox automatically choose the correct layout for any situation (including mobile), use `flex-wrap: wrap`
	* only works with fixed width/height
	* add `flex: ???px` to each box to give it that fixed height otherwise it'll all jumble into tiny slivers of long columns
* shorthand for flex-direction & flex-wrap: `flex-flow: row wrap;`
* flexbox lets you order elements using the `order: 0;` property.
	* by default all elements are 0. so if you put one element at 1, it'll come after all the rest.
* `justify-content`: defines alignment along main axis (if row, left to right).
		* flex-start (default): packed in the left side
		* flex-end: packed in the right side
		* center: packed in center
		* space-between: divies up the space between each element to fill the width of the browser
		* space around: space-between but it also does it to the sides of the first elements too
* to center content vertically (this did work for my index):
	* parent element:
	* display: flex;
	* justify-content: center;
	* flex-direction: column;
	* min-height: 100vh;
* `align-content` is like justify-content, but it works along the corss axis rather than the main access. (default top to bottom)
	* default is stretch, aligns it to fill the space.
	* all the other properties are the same as justify-content
* **you can stack justify & align content on top of each other!!**
	* don't forget to flex-wrap if it isn't working
	* double troubleshooting tip: do you have `height: 100vh;`?
* `align-items` exists too??
	* default: stretch
	* unique features: `baseline` -- aligns the bottom of each text item to be at the same place
* `align-self` does align-items but for an individual item
		* put it in the css for the specific item instead of the parent
* flex property -- proportions out the flex items equally or can be used not so equally if you put different values in different boxes
	* eg. `box: 1` is all boxes 1 + `box2: 2;` will make box2 double the space of the rest of the boxes
* some subsets of the flex property include:
	* `flex-grow` -- how should my content behave when there's extra room?
	* `flex-shrink` -- how should my content behave when there's not enough room?
	* `flex-basis` -- how should my content behave in a perfect world?
* if one of the align-versions isn't working, try the others. i don't understand the difference right now.
```

## Learned [Sass](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

I promise I learned this tonight, but I did in bed. I'll upload my notes tomorrow.


## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I wanted to finish learning CSS Grid, Flexbox, and Sass all in one day. I had enough energy left to learn CSS Grid today and get all my CSS work done within December, but I didn't think it'd be prudent to learn the two major gridding systems in one day. There needs to be some sort of break.

So, I'm postponing CSS Grid for now. It's not necessarily on my to-do list for tomorrow since I don't know if that's enough of a space between the two systems? It's just on my to-do list in general. The course I'm taking is an hour of videos, so it shouldn't take too long to learn, anyway.

Tomorrow, I'm starting JavaScript! I'm going to go through as much of [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) as I can before I inevitably get stuck. When I get stuck, I'm switching to the appropriate places in Watch & Code JS, Eloquent JS, JS: The Weird Parts, and some good old Mozilla Docs.

According to the internet, most of the essential vanilla JavaScript I need to know is in YDKJS. After that, it's maybe a quick go-through of an edX course or JS: The Weird parts, and definitely going through the algorithms section on FreeCodeCamp, then I've got vanilla JavaScript in the bag.

So, we'll see how naturally I understand a complicated book. (Spoiler Alert: My brain will probably fry within the first day.)
