**Coding Time:** Full Day

Happy day 50 of learning to code! I don't know if it's actually happy, but it is a milestone.

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Created YouTube Test Video #2](https://youtu.be/PXdHGjzFKnE)

You can watch it using the link above. 

It's a lot better than yesterday's video. I got a lot of really good feedback on it. There's still a lot left to improve, but I think I have the core structure of how I'd want my videos to be down.

However, as of this writing, I don't think I'm going to make test video #3 tomorrow. 

For the past 2 days, I've woken up pretty eager to get going and make the videos. After they were uploaded and ready to go, though, I just kept thinking "Why?"

Even though there's a void in the world, why do I have to be the one to fill it?

Why would I add more to my plate?

I owe nothing to the coding education world. 

I thought of a question a few minutes ago that really solidified this for me -- 

In 6 months, when I have a job, and when I'm only spending 40 hours a week thinking about code instead of 80, is this what I want to be doing?

The answer is no. I don't want to be a speaker. I don't want to have a Twitter. I don't want to cultivate a community. I don't want to write a book.

My idea of coding on the side is just keeping up with one or two open source contributions a month and writing one Medium article a month. Just to keep "ahead." I might not even do that, because every developer tells me that I really don't need to. Once you have a job, people knock down your door to hire you, whether you're an amazing open source developer or not.

So, why?

I want to spend my free time reading books, watching movies, playing video games, and perusing journalism. I'll keep active in my Slack communities, help out when someone needs it, but what benefit does YouTube actually give me?

So, I know that seems like my own priorities should be the most important, but I only got to this priority by facing one very important fact -- **My video is mediocre at best.** 

I could make it better, sure. But, I don't think I can make it good enough. 

I thought that my energy would exude into the microphone. It didn't. I don't know how to make it do so. Part of that is my audio set-up itself, but I also just don't know how to translate the way I am in real life or on the phone to this. 

It's great that people are able to do that, but I don't know how to without a facecam. And honestly, I just don't think I've seen it without a facecam except in gaming videos.

If you have an easy solution to fix that, you can email me. But, for the current situation -- I don't want to just add noise to the world. I wanted to make a signal, and if I can't be a signal, there's no point.

So, if tomorrow I wake up and I want to make test video #3, that's fine. But tonight, I don't want to contribute to the mediocrity on YouTube. 

I have to focus on what I really want. A great job.

## Learned about Prototypes (again)

I just opened a bunch of articles and sort of skimmed around until it clicked again. I know it's not the most effective method, but I didn't need to know all about OOP again. I'll get to detailed theory about the ins & outs of OOP once I find an actual use case for it. I really think I'm going to end up a functional die-hard once I get to that.

But, I think the best article of the bunch was [this Sitepoint article](https://www.sitepoint.com/prototypes-in-javascript/). It's super, super simple. 

So, to recap, prototypes are reusable object properties. When you create a reusable object like you do in OOP, you can add some prototypes to that. Then, when you create the derivative object, it'll inherit all of the prototypes of the original. You can then individualize the prototypes on the new one, as well.

For example, you have this object template for 100 objects. You add 9 properties to this object template. Each of the 100 uses all 8 of those 9 properties.

When you create the new object using `newObj = Object(OrigObj)`, it will inherit all 9 of those properties in the form of prototypes? I think? The words are starting to confuse me.

For the one you property you want to change, you can just manually say `newObj.j = 'Jokes on you, bud.'`. 

Before, I already knew about prototypes in the context that every object (and remember, functions are objects) gets its own built-in prototypes free from the JavaScript language. Bonus!

But, now I understand why and ...sort of how you would make your own prototypes. It's still all super theoretical, so I really need to have a project that would use objects to do it.

Either way, this is one off the list!

## [Learned about promises & Fetch](https://rainy-singer.glitch.me/)

Sorry, that doesn't even constitute a tiny app. This was a long process. I was originally trying to just make a little app that searches [this Donald Trump quote API](http://tronalddump.io) and returns the relevant quotes. 

Yeah, uh, that didn't go according to plan. Two people in my Slack chat were helping me for probably well over an hour and it was like banging our heads against the wall.

The Coding Train did warn me when I was watching his API videos that the ease of writing an API-related documentation is defined mostly by the extent of the documentation on the API. This did not have much. It was not being friendly. 

So, after all that, I just slung the tiniest possible app together using the TMDb API again because I can not be bothered to go out and make another. It pulls the data using fetch & promises. It works, I know the syntax, it's fine.

So, what were the most useful resources here? Firstly, [this article](https://davidwalsh.name/promises) which includes code from Jake Archibald that's commented out solidified it for me. I just read that code and read the comments and I got it. 

I obviously don't remember the syntax by heart, but I get it.

Then, I read [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch). Just the first example. Wrote along with it in my code. It didn't work because of the above API problem, but it should've. I got it. 

So, it's probably wrong to knock this off my list? But I want to. Really, it's just an edited list now.

I want to refactor the Alia app to be a promises thing -- but not Fetch. Then, I'm going to leave that alone. 

Then, as my final end-game vanilla JavaScript project, I'm going to make one of the apps from the FCC Intermediate Applications, and there, I'll use `async/await`. It's a much smaller syntax jump, so I should grasp it pretty easily.

## Continued [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understand-javascript)

I continue to chug slowly along this course. It's still excellent and still very difficult to get through. I got through 2 more videos today. 

1. [X] Section 1: Getting Started 5 / 5
2. [X] Section 2: Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments 13 / 13
3. [X] Section 3: Types and Operators 3 / 11
4. [ ] Section 4: Objects and Functions 19 / 23
5. [ ] Section 5: Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance 0 / 4
6. [ ] Section 6: Building Objects 0 / 8 
7. [ ] Section 7: Odds and Ends 0 / 4
8. [ ] Section 8: Examining Famous Frameworks and Libraries 0 / 4
9. [ ] Section 9: Let's Build a Framework / Library! 0 / 8
10. [ ] Section 10: BONUS Lectures 0 / 2
11. [ ] Section 11: BONUS: Getting Ready for ECMAScript 6 0 / 2
12. [ ] Section 12: Conclusion 0 / 1

Will I ever get enough time from struggling through this course to watch a video from JavaScript30? Who knows?

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

I knocked quite a bit off the old todo list today! I really feel like I'm stepping closer and closer to React.

Here's the full todo list again:

1. Learn about Functional Programming 
2. Learn the main 4 JS patterns
3. Refactor the Alia app with Promises
4. JavaScript30 (just the videos I said I will go through)
5. JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts 
6. Build one final vanilla JS app from the FCC projects using Async/Await

And once again, if JS30 and JS: Weird Parts bleed into React, I won't mind. I'll just commit to one video a day from them until I'm done. 

It still feels like the non-course things on the todo list should presumably only take one day of focused work each, so I mean... Really, hopefully soon. I can't believe I've spent 3 months on vanilla JavaScript alone. This is not a positive thing.
