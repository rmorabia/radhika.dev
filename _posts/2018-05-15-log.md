**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Started reading [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) ...Again

Fair warning, I actually did this last night after I published the post.

So, the last time I tried reading this book, I knew nothing about dynamic programming. I'd done a bunch of HTML/CSS and Linux before, but that's very different than sitting down and learning JavaScript or Python.

I was scared to start again for months. Yesterday, I said I'd start, and I did. I've committed to reading around an hour each evening.

I read more than an hour yesterday, but that's because it was so hard to read. I should clarify -- the book isn't difficult. The act of reading a book, especially a non-fiction technical book, is still extremely difficult for me. That's fine. I'll get better with practice.

I'm just pissy because Kindle said the average reading time for the first book was 100 minutes, and I spent over 100 minutes last night just reaching (nearly) the end of the first chapter.

And that's still my time even though I've read that chapter before!

Oh well, let's come back in a week and see where I am with this. I am going to finish these books, slowly but surely.

## Set up Vim on my Chromebook

Part of YDKJS is code snippets. It is conventional advice to code along to every code snippet that is in a book. I got out the Chromebook and did just that.

VS Code is EXTREMELY laggy on my Chromebook because I'm running a VM of Xubuntu and ChromeOS at the same time, and THEN VS Code is an extremely heavy app built on Electron which isn't known for accomodating little old $200 Chromebooks. I'm really stretching it there.

So, I set up Vim! It runs straight in the terminal, so I don't have to wrangle with ChromeOS' limitations to get a GUI app in a VM running.

I spent around an hour getting a bare basics `.vimrc` file and theme going. Here's a screenshot:

Looks cool, huh? Glad I got that done, now I can actually code well on the Chromebook.

## Retouched my LinkedIn a little bit

Okay, onto stuff I did today...

I rewrote a few things on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rmorabia/). Most of what's left is to write a killer summary. I'm postponing that to Sunday.

I also responded to a few recruiters, finally. I'm committed to answering every single recruiter message I get from now on. I'm going to engage and see if anything comes out of it. I know React and JavaScript, and that should technically be enough to get me a job.

One of them asked me for my resume, so I ...

## [Wrote a resume!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gZ2cBJaY8VGRtk0IS5ujbdyPtujkWeOz1-tsOKZMxoo/edit?usp=sharing)

It sucks, but it's a resume. I originally had it at two pages, but I reduced the projects to not have any bullet points and had some help with organizing the layout to fit more on one page.

I think it's a solid format given my experience. The only thing is that I'll probably change the writing over time. That's why I made it in Google Docs, so it'll be extremely easy to adjust.

Also, am I in Atlanta? No. But does anyone get hurt by thinking I am? No.

## Started working on the [React version of Cool Pics](http://github.com/rmorabia/coolpics/tree/react)

I didn't get very far with this because I only had a few hours after the LinkedIn and resume stuff.

With the few hours I had, I spent quite a bit of it trying to get the Tumblr API to work in the first place. In the old version of the app, I used jQuery's JSONP method.

For this app, I realized that Tumblr has an [npm module](https://github.com/tumblr/tumblr.js). Learning how to get Node up and running was hard. A lot of it was silly errors from not reading carefully enough (I blame docs!), but some were from the app being a bit outdated.

Once I got that working, the rest (of what I've done so far) has been simple. I just set up the form to call the data depending on the input of that form. Here's what's on my todo list:

- Add a limit of 12 to the API call
- Render images to the screen
- Implement Infinite Scroll (using a React module or NPM)
- Implement Lazy Loading (using a React module or NPM)

That's about it. I should get it all done tomorrow. As long as docs don't destroy my productivity again, this should go smoothly.

I'm glad I figured out how to get APIs/AJAX working in React today, though. It was not as hard as expected.

## Read YDKJS for an hour

I can't write about this because I'm leaving to go do that right now! If anything interesting happens, I'll write it tomorrow.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Finish the Cool Pics app and then update my resume & website to reflect the completion of this project.
