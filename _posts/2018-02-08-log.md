**Coding Time:** 1 Hour

**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished Building my [Todo List](http://rmorabia.com/todo)

I fixed the two bugs/features and pushed it out. It's done & it's perfect. I had to ask for help again, though. 

I'm really down for some reason I can't put into words. For the first time in this entire journey, I really don't want to code. I don't want to quit, and I don't need a break, I just don't want to code.

So, even though I don't need a break, I'm presumably taking a break. I don't know. Everything is muddled. There's a lot of mixed priorities. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Anything, or nothing.

Remember when this was going to be the month where I finally had the ability to go full-time for real? Nope!
