**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Learned Some Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-5obm1G_FY)

This talk was very good. It relieved a lot of my anxiety I had yesterday. It covers the basic values of the Functional Programming paradigm. I always check the comments on these programming videos or articles to see if some top comments say, "Something is completely wrong in this article. This is what's correct." There was nothing like that here, so I have to assume this is all correct.

So,t his is what Functional Programming is.

Functional Programming revolves around passing functions around to each other using callbacks, returning functions, and closures. So, that makes sense. It's a lot different than how I've been using functions just to organize code a little bit. I don't really use parameters or `return` all that much.

`return` actually only clicked for me just the other day. I think it was because of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts. So, if a function is named, that name is basically a variable. So, the return is what will be the result of that variable when the function is invoked.

For example --

```js
function name (name) {
    return 'Hi ' + name
}

console.log(name('Radhika')) // 'Hi Radhika'
```

That's pretty much the same as just doing:

```js
function name () {
    console.log('Hi Radhika')
}

name()
```

Like I normally would. They're around the same amount of text, but one is more flexible and the other is rigid. I like flexibility. It's harder to think in a flexible way, but I like it.

So, functional programming abstracts the code to make it more flexible. The idea is to mutate data (objects, arrays, even variables) as little as possible. 

You do everything inside of a function & then `return` the data you want to work with. You shouldn't `console.log` within the function because that's mutating data on the global object. You want to return the data that you later want to `console.log`.

That avoiding the global window is called avoiding side effects. 

Also, instead of using for loops, you use `.map`, `.reduce`, `.filter`, and the like. Remember that thing I spent 3 days learning about?! Well, this is the use case! It's easier to read and more efficient than a for loop.

So, with the mutating data again... If you have an array, say ` var array = [1, 2, 3]`, but then you realized you want to count up from 0 instead. In normal circumstances, you'd probably just rewrite the array.

In Functional Programming, you'd use a function to make a copy of the array and change it there.

So, that code would look like:

```js
var array = [1, 2, 3]

var newArray = array.map(() => {
    return value - 1
})
```

I ...think that's functional?

So, then there's the problem of performance when creating a million copies of things. And that goes into something called Persistent Data Structures which is where I lost it because apparently you need touse libraries and stuff.

My biggest confusion so far is how you `return` things with anonymous functions unless it's nested within another function. Well, I guess that's the answer. You can't use anonymous functions on the global object.

I mean, okay. Cool. I like this. I have more pleasant feelings about it than OOP. I just didn't see the point of OOP. But, I get that this is about organizing to avoid errors. I can do that. It's also apparently very mathy & _I am ready_. Bring on the math.

Not now, because it's useless in small projects like the ones I do right now. But, this is being added to my list of things to learn after I get a job. There's going to be a lot of nights and weekends for the first year.

## Watched [MPJ's playlist on Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)

This is the only course, paid or free, that's less than 8 hours long. Seriously. There's [this Kyle Simpson course on FrontEnd Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v2/), but I really don't want to take a full-fledged course right now when there's no obvious use case. I just want to be able to identify it in context and be familiar enough to know that it's a tool in my arsenal.

I only got through the first 3 videos today, which is fine. I can binge it tomorrow or space it out like I am with the other courses. I already am familiar with a lot of the topics covered, so I don't see any rush.

The videos in the playlist cover these topics, in order:

1. [X] Higher-order functions
2. [X] Map
3. [X] Reduce
4. [X] Closures
5. [X] Currying
6. Recursion
7. [X] Promises
8. Functors
9. Streams
10. Monads

I marked the concepts I'm already familiar with as complete, which proves there's clearly no rush to continue. 

I have notes, as well, but I'm in a bit of a rush, so I'll post them tomorrow.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

I'll probably take a day to watch as many videos as I can from MPJ's Functions playlist, JS: The Weird Parts, and JavaScript30. Just get as much of it out of the way as I can because I'm seriously going to be starting React soon.

It'll take one day to refactor my Alia app, and 1-2 (but hopefully just one!!) days to make a Random Quote generator nice. Then, it is seriously, honest to god, onto React.

Also, apparently [there's going to be a free 5 day bootcamp on React starting on April 9th]. I'm going to be attending live, but I wish it was just a week or two earlier! I'll probably have most of that stuff learned by then if I start by this weekend like I expect to. Regardless, I'll be attending all of the sessions just in case, and probably to get the information in different forms.
