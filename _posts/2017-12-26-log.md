**Coding Time:** Full Day

I know I took a few days off here. I was working, or at least trying to work, but I didn't end up accomplishing much, so I didn't think it was worth remarking upon. In particular, I was experimenting with learning styles, which I won't go into here. Regardless...

**Here's what I did today:**

### Continued Learning [HTML/CSS](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/)

I finished Sections 5 & 6 out of 12. I definitely handled this better than I would've last week. Section 6 is twice as long as Section 5, and I'm pleasantly surprised I read them both in one day.

I did so by going back and forth between my computer and my Kindle. This book has definite "reading" sections and definite "practice" sessions. If it's reading/absorbing time, I grab my notebook + fountain pen and saunder off into my bed with my Kindle. Once it's practice time, it's back on my computer.

I definitely absorb more from my Kindle, but I obviously can't practice on it. At the same time, if I'm sitting in bed too long, I start to fall asleep. This is a good balance between relaxed absorption and short, focused practice sessions. I hope I can replicate it for the books to come.

Back to the course, though...

[The website we're making is turning out to be gorgeous.](https://learn.shayhowe.com/practice/working-with-typography/index.html) (Not going to upload my source code if only because it's 90% similar to the working examples on the book's web site.)

I didn't know you could do all of this with plain CSS (+ some CSS grid for mobile-responsiveness?). I definitely don't have the design chops to think this up, regardless of the technical code behind this website. You really don't know what you don't know. This book is written with design in mind & it shows.

It's nice to know that I have this arsenal of inline-block, box-models, and semantics to fall back on when I end up designing something complicated. This book is showing the sheer possibility of design within CSS. It may be overkill for job readiness in the short-term, but I'm really enjoying it.

Here are my notes for Sections 5 & 6:

```
## css columns

* **this is all not mobile responsive, as far as i can tell**
* float: left or right will move an element to the side and the other elements will flow around it
  * eg. img { float: right; } 
	* if you want to do more than left & right (2 columns), position all to the left and adjust the width
	* use margin & width with float to column properly
* what happens when content overlaps and bleeds through?
	* clear: both can be used AFTER floats to prevent the following elements from using the space in between.
		* can be left, right, or both. preference both.
	* OR contain floats by creating a parent element that only allows wrapping within it. 
		* eg. 
				```.group:before,
					.group:after {
					  content: "";
					  display: table;
					}
					.group:after {
					  clear: both;
					}
					.group {
				  clear: both;
				  (* zoom: 1;
					}
					section {
					  float: left;
					  margin: 0 1.5%;
					  width: 63%;
					}
					aside {
					  float: right;
					  margin: 0 1.5%;
					  width: 30%;
					}```
* use inline-block + relevant width & other elements to model columns and layouts as well.
	* no need to clear floats, BUT a space will be created between the blocks which can be fixed in the HTML by starting the next section on the same line. eg. <head> </head><aside></aside>
		* this can also be fixed by commenting on the space between the lines
* position will make an element go to a specific place rather than a column
	* relative works with the flow of the page, the position it relative to itself
	* absolute is relative to the parent element and does not take into account the flow of the page
	* use box-offset (direction) to define the position from ^


## typography

* **these are all pretty common and easily searchable**
* to center text vertically within an element (like a button), set height and line-height to the same value
	* eg. .btn { height: 22px; line-height: 22px; }
* text-indent: get that fancy newspaper look
* text-shadow: exists to look like you're stuck in 2005? could look cool for a:hover
* there are only some web-save fonts: including arial, garamond, courier, times, etc.. very limited, but good for fall-back.
	* the ultimate fall-back is serif or sans-serif, though
* @font-face: use any font file you locally have or sourced from another place like google fonts
```

Quite a bit of it is not in proper syntax since Markdown recognizes HTML and thinks I actually want to bold or italicize my notes. I know what the proper syntax is for these, I just had to write them in a readable way for the notes.

## Continued [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I went up to Lesson 23 of 53 before getting too mentally exhausted to understand anything. I'm still trying to progress through this in short bursts, I don't mind how many days it takes.

Here are my notes from today:

```
* `git tag` -- checkpoints to easily refer to. [tag] can be used instead of hash
* how to revert back to master when already git add-ed? `git reset HEAD file.name` (to get rid of the add) + `git checkout file.name`
* how to revert back when already git commit-ed? `git commit HEAD` to revert to last commit, `git revert [hash]` to revert to any previous commit
	* extra: want to erase that this ever happened? `git reset --hard [hash/tag]`
* `git commit --amend -m 'message'` to fix that stupid mistake without making a whole new commit
* aliases:
	* `git co` = checkout
	* `git c` = commit
	* `git st` = status
	* `git hist` = pretty log
* `git mv` to move locally and let git know in the process, no need for git add afterwards
* `.git/config` will overwrite git settings for this project
```

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Read another 2 lessons of the HTML/CSS book & another 10 lessons of the Git book.
