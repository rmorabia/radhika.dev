**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

<p>A whole week off, you say? Yeah. Things happen. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

In the meantime, I've gotten pretty confident about the path through JavaScript. I had a good idea formulating when I last left off, and now I've solidified it further. Instead of a dark tunnel between me and building the Advanced JavaScript Projects from FCC, I see a clear path that I just need to keep walking down. I just have to keep at it. 

I don't know where to put this, but I want to acknowledge that the [JavaScript Roadmap Email Course](http://jsroadmap.com) has been super helpful in making that path much more clear than just a list of what to do in order. 

## [I Built My Third Thing](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs)

I build Thing #3 today. It's very small. It just toggles the background color of the page. But, it's the first time I'm applying the concepts of dynamic CSS to JavaScript. Now, I've done a mini-project in programming logic/math, changing the HTML, and changing the CSS. Now, it's time to combine all 3 and build something a bit more real.

## Continued watching [The Web Developer Bootcamp](http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

I don't think I had the chance to mention that this is really good. I sort of regret not starting it earlier. It felt too easy, like a cop-out. I'm now committed to working through this alongside building more in tinyjs along the way. I can't say for sure that it would've been as useful as it is now without having tried JavaScript on my own first. I might've just gotten lost in information overload.

Regardless, I'm now committed to completing the entire JavaScript section of this course. That's about 10 hours. I'm done with 2 hours so far. 

Here's a complete map of the lessons I want to complete and how many I've finished. 

* [X] Introduction to this Course 7/7
* [X] Introduction to Front End Development 4/4
* ~~Introduction to HTML 5/13~~
* ~~Intermediate HTML 0/13~~
* ~~Introduction to CSS 0/13~~
* ~~Intermediate CSS 0/16~~
* ~~Bootstrap 0/15~~
* [ ] Introduction to JavaScript 0/12
* [ ] Javascript Basics: Control Flow 0/17
* [ ] Javascript Basics: Functions 0/10
* [ ] Javascript Basics: Arrays 0/12
* [ ] Javascript Basics: Objects 0/7
* [X] DOM Manipulation 13/13
* [ ] Advanced DOM Manipulation 2/8
* [ ] Color Game Project 0/10
* ~~Intro to jQuery 0/9~~
* ~~Advanced jQuery 0/5~~
* [ ] Todo List Projects 0/11
* [ ] Project: Patatap Clone 0 / 9

I'm skipping over HTML/CSS/Bootstrap because I know it, obviously. I'm skipping over jQuery because I think it's going to help me cheat when I just want to learn how to do everything the hard way. Even though I claim to know the basics of JavaScript, I think it'd be good to go back and do the 5 hours of basic JavaScript after I finish everything from DOM Manipulation forward. I thought I knew DOM manipulation, too. Turns out, I was wrong. 

## I Almost Finished [My Fourth Thing](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs)

This is a mini-project from The Web Developer Bootcamp. It's supposed to be a code-along, but I thought I could tackle at least most of it myself, so I decided to give it a go.

It's a score keeper for games like rock-paper-scissors. It'll increase the score each time you press Player One or Two, and it'll show the winner by changing that player's score to green. There's a few other cool features like a reset button and the ability to change the score to declare a winner. 

Here were the requirements for my code:

1. When pressing Player One/Two, the respective number values should be increased by one.
2. Number limit should take the input and print it. 
3. The value should stop going up when one player reaches the winning value. 
4. When one player reaches the playingTo value, change the text color to green.
5. Reset button resets all values.
6. Number input reacts upon change, not just on click.

I finished 4 of  those 6 requirements. #3: Button should stop going up and #6: Number input reacts on change, not just click are left.

I think I can still finish #3 on my own. Maybe. It's just programming logic, but it's difficult programming logic. 

I have no clue how to do #6, but I think I might be able to figure it out by Googling details about event listeners.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

The point in the Web Developer Course that I got to is now mostly project-based. This means it might be a lot slower going than just the plain lessons. That's fine for now. Just keep moving forward, and if the projects get to be too much, go back to the basic JavaScript modules that I skipped.

Finish all the requirements for the score keeper app. Then, continue on to the next exercises and projects that the course puts forward. I'm going to continue to try to at least attempt it on my own.
