This will be fleshed out soon. This is just the basics, posted here so I don't lose it.

I want to learn **Algorithms & Data Structures**. This is just an interview level. I want to practice doing 1-2 problems a week. This feeds into that.

I want to learn **post-v16 React**. I haven't caught up on all the changes yet.

I want to learn **Node from a back-end perspective, not a full-stack perspective.** I know how I want to do this, so I don't think I can blend it with anything else.

I want to learn **testing**. I kinda know Jest, I kinda know Mocha, I kind of know Chai, I kinda know Cypress, but knowing the frameworks doesn't mean I know how to _test_.

I want to learn **system design/software architecture**. I want to know enough about this to confidently feel like a mid-level engineer who can make and contribute to decisions by the end of next year. Start with [Khalil Stemmler's blog post on this](https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/full-stack-software-design/).

I want to learn **Freshman-level CS**. If we went off of [OSSU's curriculum for context](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science#core-cs), this would constitute Core Programming, a 101 to systems, and a 101 in databases and networking. Obviously algorithms, too, but that was covered before.

I want to learn **my second language**. Probably Java because it's very different than JavaScript. Maybe Python. Either way, I want to learn a langauge of a different paradigm than I'm used to.
