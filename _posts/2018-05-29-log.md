**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Attempted and Failed [Cool Pics](http://github.com/rmorabia/coolpics/tree/react)

I spent 4 hours on this today. I got nowhere. I don't know what to do at this point. I've wasted eons of my life on this, but I feel like if I can't even implement infinite scroll in a simple React project, who am I?

Well, I'm done. Bye, Cool Pics. Maybe I'll pick you back up later.

## Read YDKJS for an hour

I'm doing this after the publishing of this post, again.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

Start the Color Game in React. Read YDKJS.
