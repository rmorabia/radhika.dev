**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Sorta Built Saoirse's Website](https://angry-wozniak-8eeb9b.netlify.com/)

The hardest part about building a website is deployment. I got this to work with a Jekyll theme, the [Forestry CMS](http://forestry.io), and a private Bitbucket repository.

That's most of the work. There's still quite a bit left to do, but it probably won't drain me to the extent that today did. 

## Refactored the [Alia app](http://github.com/rmorabia/alia)

It's done. I refactored it. That's my final version for now. Cool. Done.

## Continued [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http//udemy.com/understand-javascript)

Here's where I am now. 66% done.

Today, we talked about Object Oriented JavaScript and Prototypal inheritance. I took a few notes:

```
* inheritance - one object gets access to the properties and methods of another object
* All objects lead to the BASE object which has no prototype
* Reflection - an object can look at itself, listing and changing its properties and methods
* Extend - combines all the prototypes of many objects into one object
    * WITHOUT getting involved in the prototype chain
    * this just places the prototypes onto the main object
```

I'm glad I have a deeper understanding of prototypes now, but I am looking forward to tomorrow, more. I still don't understand new, constructor functions, etc., at all. 

I also finally reached the 66% mark. Here's where I am:

1. [X] Section 1: Getting Started 5 / 5
2. [X] Section 2: Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments 13 / 13
3. [X] Section 3: Types and Operators 11 / 11
4. [X] Section 4: Objects and Functions 23 / 23
5. [X] Section 5: Object-Oriented Javascript and Prototypal Inheritance 4 / 4
6. [ ] Section 6: Building Objects 0 / 8 
7. [ ] Section 7: Odds and Ends 0 / 4
8. [ ] Section 8: Examining Famous Frameworks and Libraries 0 / 4
9. [ ] Section 9: Let's Build a Framework / Library! 0 / 8
10. [ ] Section 10: BONUS Lectures 0 / 2
11. [ ] Section 11: BONUS: Getting Ready for ECMAScript 6 0 / 2
12. [ ] Section 12: Conclusion 0 / 1

## Started Learning React

By the time I got to this, I was exhausted. I tried looking at the [Egghead.io course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs). As I suspected, it moved way too fast for me.

Then, I moved onto the React docs, but it was already quite late and it was very hard to read for me.

I looked at the React courses on Udemy, and I believe I am leaning towards [this course by Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/). The fact that it's 36.5 hours does not excite me at all.

Regardless, it's either the documentation or that.

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

So, I'll start learning React with gusto tomorrow. I'm going to take another look at the documentation and see if it's enough for me once I have fresh eyes. 

Before that, though, I still have to:

1. [Watch the Monads video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QveBbn7t_c)
2. Go through 45 more minutes of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
3. Watch one video of JavaScript30 (possibly a refresh tomorrow?)
4. Might have to work on Saoirse's website again

Then, React with feeling!
