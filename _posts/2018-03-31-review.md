title: "Month in Review: March"
categories: review
---

Guess who's finally done working on learning vanilla JavaScript? Me!

I doubt this month was more productive than the last few, but slowly chugging along meant I eventually made progress. Just one focused day was worth 3 unfocused days.

Here are the numbers...

I spent **16 of 31 days** learning to code.

That seems pretty on par with the other months.

The approximate amount of time I spent coding is **90 hours**.

I think these hours keep getting lower and lower since so much time is spent having new concepts sink in. I'm not sure. These numbers bother me less and less these days. They were a cool metric to consider back when I first starting to keep me motivated, but they just seem silly now.

I may get rid of the hourly count next month. It's just pointless.

## What I Wanted to Acccomplish in March

1. 100% JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts
2. Finish however much of JavaScript30 I want to finish until I FEEL finished
3. Go through Modern JavaScript From the Beginning
4. Learn about Functional Programming
5. Code at least 3 projects, regardless of the source (FCC, my brain, a codealong I choose to skip from a course)

**BONUS STUFF THAT WOULD'VE MADE ME FEEL GOOD IF IT HAPPENED:**

1. Clearing through the articles I’ve accumulated on these topics I’ve been trying to learn this month. I have a lot in my Instapaper that are just so ignored.
2. Watching more of The Coding Train <3
3. Maybe finishing all of this enough to start learning React?
4. Actually fixing Kevin’s and my websites!

As it happens every month, those goals changed.

## What I Actually Accomplished in March

### (Basically) Finished [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understand-javascript)

Okay, I have one major section left. It's as good as done, though. I'm glad I finished this.

I'm sure I'll need to go through it again and again, though. It changed the way I code, as everyone told me it would, but it was such a slow burn. I think I'll binge it on nights & weekends once I'm a few months into a job again. I'll come away with different insights.

11. [ ] Section 11: BONUS: Getting Ready for ECMAScript 6 0 / 2
12. [ ] Section 12: Conclusion 0 / 1

### Gave up on [JavaScript30](http://javascript30.com)

After a month of procrastinating, I decided I don't have to do this to myself. I know that I want to go through it on my own. I know that I don't have the time or the energy to go through it on my own right now. I can do it later.

### Changed my editor's style

I'm a pro coder now.

I use Solarized Light, [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), ligatures on, and even a special spacing between characters. My code editor's readability is completely gorgeous now. I can stare at this style for 8 hours a day without any problems. It's perfect.

Here's my exact editor settings, if you'd like to copy it:

```js
{
  "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
  "editor.fontSize": 20,
  "workbench.colorTheme": "Solarized Light",
  "editor.wordWrap": "on",
  "editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code'",
  "editor.letterSpacing":1,
  "editor.lineHeight": 24,
  "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```

### Started and Returned [Modern JavaScript from the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning)

This course from [Brad Traversy](http://traversymedia.com) had all the topics I wanted to cover in my intermediate JavaScript deep dive. But, structured education on advanced topics is rarely good.

This was just a very fast code codealong. I'm not a super theoretical person, but I like some theory. I especially like context.

In his beginner videos, he kept saying, "You don't need to understand what this does," for his code examples. Of course, I happened to know what he said we didn't need to understand because of my past JS experience. But, this didn't bode well for when he started to explain AJAX and stuff.

So, I asked for a return. On Udemy, there's a reason the most popular courses are the most popular courses. They're usually better. Trust in the numbers.

Udemy processed my return very quickly. I have a lot of problems with Udemy as a platform, but they were very good about this from a student standpoint.

### Started to think more seriously about being job-ready

When you look at job listings under the keyword "React," I have everything on the list except for the React. But, since I'm starting the React this month, I should theoretically be able to start applying for jobs starting in May.

I still don't have a professional-looking picture on my profiles. I don't need to do a photoshoot or anything, but I just need a current-ish picture of me smiling at the camera. That's hard. I'm working on it, but it's just really hard to get myself to do.

I'd prefer it to not be a selfie, too. Hard to get someone to take a picture of me without the smile looking like I'm possessed by a demon.

Other than the picture nonsense, though, I've been thinking about other things. 

I changed [my LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rmorabia) title to "Frontend Web Developer specializing in React & JavaScript." I also changed my location to Atlanta, Georgia, so recruiters there can find me. Lastly, I made my last "job" a "Freelance React/JavaScript Developer" since December.

I've been showing up in more search appearances and I've gotten notifications that "Someone with the job title Recruiter" looked at your profile. 

I don't know how many views are a good number of views, but I haven't gotten any viable messages from recruiters yet. We'll see if this pans out in any way.

I should rewrite the copy at the beginning of my website to reflect this, too.

I also finally found a resume template that speaks to me, and I can actually start working on my resume.

Even if I can't get a job through networking and meetups, I now know that a CV is my chance to explain to hiring people to please see my portfolio. It's my best front about explaining myself and who I am.

This means I have to keep working on making it better, though! I want to add JavaScript to it.

I need to make my navigation bar responsive, maybe refresh the design a little (the font is so small), make the projects have lightboxes which will go into detail about my thoughts on the project, and maybe add a few new sections on the portfolio for my published writing and a feed of my open source contributions.

If I want to stand out, I have to make all of this happen! I think it'd be best to do all of this after I learn React, though. Maybe I can and should remake the entire website in React.

Lastly, I [solved FizzBuzz](https://rmorabia.com/2018/03/04/log). I'm much more confident about applying to jobs after the work I put in this month.

### Learned about AJAX/API/Async

I jumped through a plethora of resources to learn how AJAX works. I now know:

* What is Async?
* What is AJAX?
* What is an API?
* How do I use AJAX & APIs in JavaScript? (No jQuery)
* JavaScript Promises
* Fetch API

What I don't know is how to use AJAX in a non-API context. Like, that whole concept of loading content without refreshing the page using AJAX. How do you do that? I don't know.

### Built my [Alia app](http://rmorabia.com/alia)

This is my pride and joy. Before I knew how to program, I thought this would be the hardest app in the world to make. If I could make this, I'd be a pro! 

_Well_. That's partially true.

It's the first app that's going to stay on my portfolio until the end. This app also made me realize I can't make a whole project for every single concept I learn.

Most of this app wasn't about the AJAX itself. There was still so much design to do, so much data to organize, and so many edge cases to think about.

When I built this, I didn't know about Promises or the Fetch API. I originally thought I'd make a whole new project (like a weather app) just for that.

Yeah, uh... no. I know practice makes perfect, but I just don't see the point in doing all of the JS to make the non-API related weather stuff just to learn about Promises.

I'll still be using AJAX/APIs, etc., with React. So, just build a tiny app and move on. 

I left `async/await` for another day. I'll get to it when I need it. 

### Started & Ended a YouTube channel???

I think I was getting too embroiled in the lack of a good resource to learn all of this advanced JS. I was convinced I'd make a channel, it'd be great, and everyone would stop suffering like I was.

But, I knew it wasn't something I really wanted to spend my time on. I wanted it to exist, I didn't necessarily want to be the one to make it exist.

Once I figured out that I don't have the natural ability to make perfect videos, I gave up. Phew. 

It was a fun learning experience, but even if I was to do it, it's too soon. 

### Became familiar with Object-Oriented Programming

I now have a pretty solid familiarity with OOP from a variety of sources. It seems more like a design pattern than a full-blown programming paradigm.

Regardless, I know enough of it that I can recognize it when I see it, and when asked, I can attempt to change my programming style into an OOP style.

### Became familiar with Functional Programming

I'm 99% sure I lean more towards the functional camp. It's still a lot to learn and very different than my coding style, but it makes some sense. I'm trying to integrate the basics of it into the code I'm writing from now forwards.

The math stuff seems hard. It seems to go deep. Even my introductory videos got into use case my little apps would just never have a use for. But, I can expand upon it as my codebase expands, too.

### [Learned Some JavaScript Design Patterns](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/4-javascript-design-patterns-you-should-know)

Again, this is just to become familiar. I now understand what these design patterns are useful for.

I like the Module Pattern best, and I think I actually used a form of it in my Alia app. It's good to become familiar so when someone talks about design patterns, I'm not completely in the dark.

### [Started Learning React](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

I bought a 37 hour course. As of March 31st, I'm less than 3 hours in. It's hard to go from knowing JavaScript really well to learning basics all over again. I've been really resistant to learning it thus far, but whenever I do actually sit down and watch a video, it's all been very easy so far.

Here's my progress so far:

1. [X] Section 1: Welcome 2 / 2
2. [X] Section 2: Setting up Your Environment 3 / 3
3. [ ] Section 3: Hello React 12 / 16

## What I Didn't Get to Accomplish in March

I don't have many regrets.

I guess I could've gotten a little further into React? I had some days at the end of the month that have just been wasted.

Maybe I could've built more projects? Even though I didn't want to with the knowledge I had?

I possibly could've actually watched at least one video of JavaScript30?

I don't know. I'm satisfied. We're done with vanilla JS. April is React month. Onwards and upwards.

### What I Want to Accomplish in April

This is going to be a pretty short list.

1. Finish the React course.
2. Build one solo project in React.
3. Build one collaborative project in React.

That's about it.

**BONUS STUFF:**

1. Write some articles on React. (I'll explain this when I do it.)
2. FIX KEVIN'S WEBSITE.
3. Work on my own website.
4. Work on Saoirse's website.
5. Build any extra React projects.

There's just a lot of side maintenence that has been falling completely to the wayside. It's hard to keep up with when I'm so laser focused on learning.

We'll see how much I get done, even with this conservative list.
