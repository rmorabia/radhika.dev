**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Changed my editor's style

I knew I wanted to do this eventually, I just didn't know when. It actually took me around 3 hours to decide on my final choices.

I looked at VS Code themes. The default Solarized Light is the best for me. It's what I've been using for a while now. The main text is black and any other colors are pretty pastel. The background is a nice yellowish. It's very easy on the eyes. 

Every other light theme I tried had a background color that just wasn't as good as this yellow.

Then, I decided it was time to change the font.

This is what separates a pro from an amateur, in my humble opinion. I used to have a specific set of font design I would use when I was writing online before (Georgia, 16px, 1.2). I can't be a professional coder unless I have an opinionated setup!

So, I found [this site](http://app.programmingfonts.org/) and it changed everything I thought I knew about how these typefaces looked in pictures. I thought something like `CamingoCode` looked great in the pictures. It looks terrible in the editor.

However, when I went to install some of them on my editor (`BPmono`), they looked terrible in my editor! So, it was a dual-filtering process.

I finally settled on [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), which is apparently really popular in the dev community. There were a few other choices that came close to the final mark (`Inconsolata-g`, `Hasklig`, `Source Code Pro`), but once I saw Fira, I knew. Every letter looks really distinct, and it supports ligatures. Ligatures mean that when I type `=>` in JavaScript, it'll change into a fancy picture automatically. It's gorgeous. I'm blown away.

I changed some other settings related to the font. Here's the total of my settings, now:

```js
{
    "workbench.startupEditor": "newUntitledFile",
    "editor.fontSize": 20,
    "workbench.colorTheme": "Solarized Light",
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "editor.fontFamily": "'Fira Code'",
    "editor.letterSpacing":1,
    "editor.lineHeight": 24,
    "editor.fontLigatures": true
}
```

In particular, I bumped the font size up by 4. I feel kind of ashamed of needing such a large font size to be able to read comfortably, but I can finally lean back in my chair and see just fine.

I'm really happy with my set-up now. This may be some inconsequential nonsense that's a waste of a day, but I think in the long run, this will be good for me.

Here's a picture of how my editor looks now:

On an unrelated note, I also finally organized my filesystem to put all of my code within a specific folder instead of scattered all around my Home folder.

## Started [Modern JavaScript From the Beginning](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning)

Starting this on March 3rd is not a fortuitous sign for the rest of the month's productivity, but hey, I'm trying.

Here's a breakdown of my progress like the other courses:

1. [X] Section 1: Intro & Getting Started 3 / 3
2. [ ] Section 2: JavaScript Language Fundamentals 5 / 17
3. [ ] Section 3: DOM Manipulation & Events 0 / 12
4. [ ] Section 4: DOM Projects 0 / 10
5. [ ] Section 5: Object Oriented JavaScript - ES5 & ES2015 0 / 7
6. [ ] Section 6: OOP Book List Project 0/ 6
7. [ ] Section 7: Asynchronous JavaScript, Ajax & Fetch API 0 / 15
8. [ ] Section 8: API Projects 0 / 9
9. [ ] Section 9: Error Handling & Regular Expressions 0 / 6
10. [ ] Section 10: Other Newer Features - ES2015+ 0 / 6
11. [ ] Section 11: JavaScript Patterns 0 / 7
12. [ ] Section 12: Tracalorie Project (Using The Module Pattern) 0 / 12
13. [ ] Section 13: Microposts Project - CRUD Front End (Webpack & Babel) 0 / 8
14. [ ] Section 14: Wrap Up 0 / 1

It's 22 hours long and I'm pretty interested in most of the content of this course, so I'm really hoping I can get through it faster than I've been getting through the other courses.

Anyway, onto talking about what I learned today...

Already in the intro, I've heard things that I didn't know before. Did you know VS Code has an HTML boilerplate built in if you type `!` and then hit the Tab key? Who knew?

I thought I was going to skip the first section on JavaScript fundamentals, but it talks about JavaScript in a ES6 context, which is something I haven't seen before. Same thing with the DOM section. There's just enough from the video titles that tells me that there's stuff here I haven't seen before. So, it's worth going through all of it.

I'm already taking notes in the first video, so here are all of my notes to reference for future me or anyone else reading this:

```
* ! + Tab to create HTML boilerplate
* console.time() + (code) + console.timeEnd() to log how long it takes for your JS to load
* you can edit the individual items in const arrays & objects, you just can't edit the array/object as a whole. use const more often.
* objects & arrays & functions are called REFERENCE data types, while all that other stuff you already knew is called PRIMITIVE data types
* Type Conversion Examples: `val = String(5)` & `val = Number(true)`
```

That's it for now. I'm about 7% done with the course. It's pretty easy to go through so far. I just hope I'll get started earlier tomorrow. 

## Got distracted by data structures & algorithms

I'm scared for these technical interviews. How much do I need to know? How many trick questions will they give me? Do I start now or cram later?

I don't know. I signed up for some stuff like [LeetCode](http://leetcode.com) anyway even though I really do not have the time to start focusing on this.

I don't know. 

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Try to get less distracted and actually go through the 3 courses?
