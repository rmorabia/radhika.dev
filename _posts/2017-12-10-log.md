**Coding Time:** 1 hour-ish

**Here's what I did today:**

## Started to Learn the Command Line

Today, I realized I have a problem with learning things I already know. I get extremely distracted and can lose myself for hours. To get to that flow state that keeps me working all night, I have to be working on something I don't know.

Does this mean I'm going to lose book learning and switch to project-based learning? Not yet. In the case of building Kevin's site & my site, I just took shortcuts. I don't know why anything worked. I just made sure it did. That doesn't seem smart for the long-term.

So, my middle ground is that I don't have to read through a book cover to cover. I hate the beginnings of books the most. In today's case, I already know what bash is, what ls is, what cd is. I can skim all the way to when I don't know something. Then, I focus on it.

Hopefully, this actually accomplishes something & I'm not just destined to never learn again.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I'm going to go through the command line book and actually finish it tomorrow. It's short enough that I really should get time to at least work through some of the Git book. I will skim through that, too.
