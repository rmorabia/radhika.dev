**Coding Time:** Full Day


**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished [Learning Git](http://gitimmersion.com)

I quickly finished the last few chapters. I'm glad to be done with that. I think I already had a good understanding of Git since I've been using it for years now, but the book introduced me to some workflows that I hadn't thought of as a single contributor who mostly just uses GitHub.


## Continued Building [My Portfolio Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

I'm officially starting my mini-Hackathon for the website at 1:30 PM. Let's see how far I can get today.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Read the last 2 lessons of the HTML/CSS book & the last 10 lessons of the Git book.

For the website, here's what's left:

- Choose and add a font for the entire body
- Edit the experience timeline (the writing in this is going to be much harder than the coding, I'm telling you now)
- Set up 6 Projects cards in a responsive grid
- Finish the contact form, possibly adding a grid to have an aside that says "I hate social media!" 
- Create the footer

Will I finish tomorrow? Probably not. Will I finish by the New Year? Maybe.
