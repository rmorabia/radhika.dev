**Coding Time:** Half Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Solved FizzBuzz

Apparently, FizzBuzz is this programming problem that a lot of interviewers give to their applicants just to check if they can actually code or not. The portfolios can be copy/pasted, no one really knows if someone's code is theirs or not, and all projects start to look the same after a while.

So -- Can your programmer actually code? Here's the question for them to solve:

> The "Fizz-Buzz test" is an interview question designed  to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can't seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag. The text of the programming assignment is as follows:
>
> "Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

So, I read that, and I was scared. 99.5%! If they can't do it, I probably can't!

I sat down to do it, and 5 minutes later (seriously), I had a working solution. I don't understand? Maybe it's harder in other programming languages? But I doubt it? I did a bit of coding in C for CS50 and I'd solve it similarly.

Anyway, here's my code:

```js
(function fizzBuzz () {
 for (let i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
   if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 === 0) {
     console.log('FizzBuzz')
   } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
     console.log('Fizz')
   } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
     console.log('Buzz')
   } else {
     console.log(i)
   }
 }
})()
```

That's it. I could swear I could've done that on the first days I learned to code. [That exercise in You Don't Know JS: Up & Going](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs) is harder than that! Granted, that took me a few hours, so yes, practice makes perfect, but I love conditionals.

I'm sure that if I do get the FizzBuzz question, it'll be a variation (only print the even numbers), so that may take me a bit longer to get the logic down, but I think it'll still be a respectable period of time? 

The only thing I did where I think I may be cheating is that I did it by testing every conditional, I can't do it off the top of my head in order. I do one at a time. So, if I was doing this on paper, I'd have to rewrite it every time I added a new condition.

As in, first I built the for loop and logged 1 - 100. Then, I added Fizz. Then, I added Buzz. I ended with FizzBuzz. But, that's in reverse reading order. So. Maybe that's why it's hard?

I'm not sure.

But, it's good practice. I'm going to start spending a little bit of time trying to prepare for interviews now. I need to split my time into theory/interviews/algorithms and practical/React/projects. 

Right now, [JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts](http://udemy.com/understanding-javascript) fills my quota for this stuff. After that, [I starred a few things on GitHub I have to go through](https://github.com/rmorabia?tab=stars). Lastly, I [bought a course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/) that should cover the rest of what I need to know.

I want to think about one question/algorithm/concept every day. I'll write all about it on here. 

But, I still have to get back to learning the practical stuff.

I've been taking the notes from this section on index cards. I don't know why. I don't know where to put them? But they're just random little notes rather than full-blown conceptual pages.

My programming notes are a complete mess. I should probably figure out a cross-platform way to hold them that doesn't disgust me, but I can really only think on paper. ...Evernote with it's scanning possibilities? Gross. 

I don't need it yet since this blog has served me well so far. I really want to install a search box here, but for now, Googling "[concept] site:rmorabia.com" works well enough.

Anyway, enough note-taking theory, here's what I learned today:

```
* template literals are basically only useful when you want to do multiple lines of html. i'm still comfortable with old school string stuff, and that's okay because i haven't had to replace entire swathes of text.
    * but i mean at least now i know how they work. backticks around and then {$nonsense} to pass in variables, functions, whatever
```
## Tomorrow's To-Do's

That's all for todays. Some stuff popped up again. Another day, another opportunity.
