**Coding Time:** Half day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Continued to work on the [Alia app](http://rmorabia.com/alia)

This got hard fast. Mobile responsiveness without a framework is the hell on earth I was not expecting.

I don't think the above link even works properly. 

I finished all the data-pulling part of this app. So, that's something.

Here's what's left:

* To embed the YouTube trailer in a working & attractive fashion or to just link it?
* Attribution footer on both index & countdown pages
* MOBILE-RESPONSIVENESS! 

I probably just need to sit down, make it work on desktop, and then not touch that code and put all the new code in media queries. Just rewrite the app twice. It's fine.

The bulk of it is done now. The YouTube part is the hardest & I should probably just give up and leave it for another time. 

The order at which I'll tackle these is as follows:

1. Attribution footer
2. Mobile-responsive
3. YouTube trailer instead of link

I expect that I'll work on it for one more day & then I'll be done -- regardless of where that YouTube trailer stands.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Finish the app.
