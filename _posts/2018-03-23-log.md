**Coding Time:** Half Day

I'm not continuing with this song, but if you get this reference, you're my new best friend.

**Here's what I did today:**

## (Almost) [Finshed Learning Some Functional Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84)

I have one video left in MPJ's playlist. It's on monads. I will go through that tomorrow.

Here are the notes I promised:

```
Higher-Order Functions
    * makes code easier logic to follow
    * lets you reuse a lot more code
    * functions are values, they can be used like ANY other value
    * COMPOSITION - use functions in other functions

Map
    * higher order functions are the functions that callback functions get called into
    * map TRANSFORMS every item in an array into a new array

Reduce
    * reduce can do just about anything
    * Returns a single value
    * Reduce wants a starting point
    * eg. 
        * `var amount = order.reduce ( function (sum, index) { return sum + index .value }, 0)`
    
Recursion
    * when a function calls itself until it doesn't
    * eg. while?
    
Functors
    * an object that has the requirements to run `.map`
    * eg. array
    * Requirements:
        1. The object content can be transformed
        2. The mapping will maintain structure
            * eg. give 3, get 3
        3. Return a new functor
    * generic container for anything
    
Stream
    * stream of data
    * a flow of data that will arrive eventually
    * why? read one row of data at a time & process one line at a time
    * uses a streaming library like Highland.js or Rx.js
    * keep data and functions SEPARATE
```

My notes got more sparse as the videos went on. By the end, I was just thinking about getting familiar with the vocabulary than actually having a use case.

I'm now familiar enough that if I ever want to go deeper, I can look into [Kyle Simpson's book](http://fljsbook.com) without fear.

## Refactored my [Alia app](http://github.com/rmorabia/alia) to use Promises

I also tried to make it functional, but I probably failed at that, so I'm leaving that out of this title.

Today, I learned you can use `.then`s within `.then`s. I have achieved my peak.

I don't have much to say about this. I know how promises work now. I'm happy with it. I got down from 10 gajillion global variables to 0. It's much cleaner code.

I think the most important thing to note is that I added a real README. It has a gif, too. I encourage you to click through and read it. It's not too long and I think it's a lot better than my last one. This is the new format I'm going to follow for all of my apps, gif and all. 

I got exhausted by this implementation, and didn't actually take the time to really refactor it. I have to do that tomorrow.

Coding this made me realize I don't care about making another one API app by doing a FCC project. I want to move on. I can always make more later. 

## Tomorrow’s To-Do’s

There's a lot of loose ends to complete before I can actually move on to React, but I think I am starting React tomorrow.

1. [Watch MPJ's video on Monads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QveBbn7t_c)
2. Actually read through my Alia code and refactor it line by line
3. Maybe actually fix Kevin's site??? How long has this been on my todo list for a 10-15 minute fix?

Also, I want to prioritize getting through the video courses before React.

So, instead of being a bonus point at the end of the day, it is now a requiremen that every day, before I can get to React, I have to get through:

* 45 minutes of JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts AND
* 1 video of JavaScript30

If something's super complex and takes the whole day, that's fine. My priority is finishing these two more than learning React.

So, if I finallly get to React, I'm going to start by [watching this Egghead.io course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-reactjs).

After that, I have to decide if I'm going to get by on [the official documentation](http://reactjs.org), buy a Udemy course, or subscribe to someone like [Tyler McGinnis](http://tylermcginnis.com). The earlier I decide this, the faster React will go.
