**Coding Time:** Half day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Finished the [Alia app](http://rmorabia.com/alia)

I woke up this morning and I remembered I still had to fix this YouTube thing. This unfixable CSS! This struggle with making the `<iframe>` responsive, but yet still keeping the container centered vertically & horizantally!

`min-height: 100vh`

I solved it in two minutes by just adding that min in the front. I can't believe the fix was that simple. It just proves that last night, I wasn't even really reading my CSS, just hacking at it with an axe until it worked.

So, now the YouTube trailer is going to be embedded. I got the CSS for making it responsive from [here](https://avexdesigns.com/responsive-youtube-embed/).

Making the attribution was a bit of a struggle. The API requires both a line of text & a logo. So, my most elegant solution was to split screen it using flex again. 

For the countdown timer, I actually had to look at a [tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-javascript-countdown-timer-no-dependencies/). I couldn't fathom how to turn a date like `2018-03-16` into a running time. It turns out, JavaScript has a built-in function that'll get a date in milliseconds. So, just subtract the current date from the release date, and there's your time in milliseconds. Then, just convert it to days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

I feel pretty bad about having to follow a tutorial. I thought I could build it on my own. I didn't try too hard before I turned to the tutorial, though. I didn't write down all of the requirements and break down the problem step by step. I'm not sure how I feel about this. I'm tired. I just want to be done with this app.

I made it mobile-responsive, as well. 

I need a break from the app now. It's done for now. I need to refactor it & make it faster, but I don't really know how just yet. It's done. There's just bonus points left to go. 

There's still several more API apps I have to make, with several different functionalities:

* JavaScript promises
* Async/Await
* Different API calling methods like Fetch API

Will I ever get to learning React & Node? Who knows?

I think the best solution is to just make tiny apps with these things & continue to refactor them into this project. Apparently, React doesn't have its own methods for using AJAX, so whatever apps I make in React will still need a fundamental knowledge of this stuff.

I really wish I understood the theory behind it like I do with scope now. The only resource I can think of to cover this is Kyle Simpson.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I took a break for the rest of the day after the app was built.

Tomorrow, I think I'm going to take a break from AJAX and let it sink in for a few days. So, I'll be continuing with JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts, JavaScript30, and maybe some other raw theory learning.

To recap, here's what's left on ye olde vanilla JavaScript to-do list:

* Prototypes in OOP (I still don't think I understand the point of these)
* Functional Programming introduction
* AJAX
  * Promises
  * Async/Await
  * Fetch, Rest, etc..
* 4 main JavaScript patterns
* JavaScript30 (only the days I listed previously)
* JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts (100%, currently at 51%)
