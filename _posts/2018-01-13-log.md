**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## [I Built My First Thing](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs)

Carousels seem hard.

The distance between the carousel and I still seems vast. 

So, I decided to start a mini-multi-project. 10/12 tiny, tiny, tiny projects between me and functional small apps. I'm trying to bridge the difference between tiny and small.

Here's a list of 13 ideas I have, sort of in order but I can't actually judge difficulty:

1. Hello, Name!
1. That 30-line thing we made in the YDKJS intro book BUT IN THE DOM
1. Tooltip that changes color depending on which button you click? Basically something simple that will change CSS with JavaScript
1. Tiny Luck-Based Game -- Choose a door, win a prize! The door is random!
1. Carousel/Slideshow
1. Accordion/Dropdown Menu
1. Quiz that grades your answers
1. Random Color Generator 
1. Micro-blog thing -- Looping through an array of mini-posts
1. The Almighty To-Do List, from scratch this time
1. Countdown Timer
1. Paint App
1. Plain Text Editor

I am aware that half of those don't make sense. They don't make much sense to me, either. Regardless, it's the idea of building iterative projects that continue to build on what you learned last time & continue to push new challenges.

First, the basics of DOM manipulation with HTML.
Then, DOM manipulation with CSS.
Then, programming logic with CSS & HTML.

& The list keeps going until you get to small apps. 

Once you can build a small app (or 3!), you can build anything given enough time! That's the point I'm trying to cross.

So today, I built my first app. It asks you for your name & then prints out "Hello NAME!" Despite the JavaScript only being 5 lines long, it took me a few hours to finish.

Here were the app requirements (as per Watch & Code):

1. It should ask the user what their name is with an input element.
1. There should be a button that triggers the output.
1. The output should say "Hello NAME!"

That's it. Simplest app possible. 

Still, it took me about 2 hours to complete...

Let me say something now... MDN Docs were NOT helpful. I don't know in what situations people find them to be useful, but my most helpful Googling was a mix of W3Schools (I know, I know) to get quick overviews of specific things and StackOverflow for the unconnected concepts in my head.

Here were the individual steps to take after figuring out the requirements:

1. Get a working prototpye working in the console, including prompting the user to input their name.
1. Write barbones HTML page for what the program will look like.
1. Figure out how to store name when clicking okay. 
1. Figure out how to display full text "Hello NAME!" when clicking okay.

Steps 1, 2, and 4 were easy.

Step 3 is where you're really applying DOM manipulation, which is something I understood in theory, and only now (partially) understand in practice. These were the mistakes I made:

* Script souce must always be at the bottom of the HTML body
* Variables are always outside of functions. They can be in objects.
* querySelector selects the name of a certain element
* Print the VALUE of the input form, not the whole input form

Since I forgot querySelector even existed, I had some super complicated 20-line code that was variables upon variables that never actually triggered the button to do anything.

Hopefully, using it in practice like this will solidify the DOM elements like getDocumentById & querySelector for me. 

You can see the working app [here](http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs)! I'm pretty proud of it. It took problem-solving to get to the end result, as small as it is.

This felt a lot like writing a website with just HTML/CSS again. You code what you can, then you run into a multi-hour problem. You solve it. You move on. That's good. That's how it's supposed to feel. 

## Began Building Thing #2

The second project is a DOM version of the [first coding exercies in YDKJS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md#practice). I tackled this previously on the blog, but now it's time to retackle it and take user inputs.

This builds on the previous app by adding in programming knowledge while reiterating the DOM. 

Here are the requirements:

1. Follow the requirements/steps for the console version of the app as listed in YDKJS.
1. Create inputs for bankBalance and spendingThreshold.
1. Display total & if the user can afford the purchase.

I vaguely started writing the app, but it just wasn't going well, so I...

## Started to Continue watching The Web Developer Bootcamp

Seems tough to program 2 apps in one day. So, this is going to be my side hobby as I go through this little project.

I'll be writing down physical notes, but for now I won't be coding along. I may tomorrow.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

Finish App #2! Hopefully do so early enough in the day to get a nice, solid break before possibly starting App #3?

If not, definitely continue The Web Developer Bootcamp!
