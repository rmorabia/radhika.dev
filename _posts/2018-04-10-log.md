**Coding Time:** Full Day

**Here's what I did today:**

## Watched Day 2 of [Tyler McGinnis' Free React Bootcamp](https://tylermcginnis.com/free-react-bootcamp/)

Same results as yesterday. I followed along well in the first half and lost my entire brain in the second half. 

Oh well. It's a good motivator.

## Continued [Learning React](https://www.udemy.com/react-2nd-edition/)

Continued motivation to work quicker than before!
