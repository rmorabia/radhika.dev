**Coding Time:** Finding it difficult to keep track of time spent accurately. Might change to saying "Full Day," "Half Day," or "Just an hour" to simply define how long I felt I worked that day.

**Here's what I did today:**

## [Continued to Learn the Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)

I'm changing up my tactics. I've been finding it difficult to "binge" this book. So instead, I'm going to start doing just one section a day. Today, I finished Section 9 of 13. The presumed applicability goes further and further downhill with each section at the same time as the difficulty rises higher and higher. This makes each section take longer than the last. Just 4-5 more days at this pace, and then I can safely say I have a very solid foundation on using the command line.

I once again felt disillusioned with this specific book and looked into video courses. I was wrong to do so and I yet again wasted precious time.

I'm still not sure that this is the most directly relevant book for me (especially compared to the description of the video course I was considering). My conclusion is simply that I can fill in the gaps along the way with Google and StackOverflow. That probably would've been a smarter idea than reading this book anyway. Learn as you go.

Here are my (messy) notes from Sections 1-8:

```
* to cd from the root directory, lead with a /. eg. cd /usr/bin vs cd usr/bin
* to cd from the home directory, lead with a ~. eg. cd ~/rmorabia vs cd rmorabia
* cd . = working directory
* cd .. = parent of working directory
* cd (alone ) changes to home directory
*  **file names are case sensitive**
*  ls -a to see hidden files
*  ls -l for long detailed list
*  file tells you what file type it is
*  Tab autocompletes commands
*  backslash (\) in front of a character to nullify its effects. (eg. cd Calibre\ Library)
*  **man [command] is your new best friend**
    *  *or I mean, there's always just [command] --help*
    *  man -k to keyword search all manual pages
    *  /[search] within a manual page
*  mkdir -p(arent directories automatically made too)
*  combine onecharacter options like -al to do multiple options at once
*  rmdir is to mkdir
    * *but it must be empty*
*  touch makes new files (of any extension)
    * i think i'm getting kind of woo-ey with these notes but what the hell kind of command name is touch
* cp = copy (file) copy -r (directory)
* mv = move file or directory
    * use mv in same directory to rename it. eg. mv foo foo3
* rm is to touch as rmdir is to mkdir
* **rm -r removes an entire directory**
  *  -i prompt before deleting each file just in case
* cat to view small files, less to view large files
	* tac to view files in reverse
* **Ctrl + C is the universal cancel/exit sign**
* use wildcards to get inprecise//multiple answers:
  * " * - zero or more characters "
  * ? - single characters
  * [] - range of characters
  * eg. ls * .txt to find all of the files that end in .txt (no space)
  * eg. move all images to another directory: mv public_html/* .??g public_html/images
* linux permissions for files:
	* r - read
	* w - write
	* x - execute
	* owner - single person who owns the file
	* group - every file belongs to a single group
	* others - everyone else who is not in the group or the owner of the file
* change permissions:
	* chmod [u(ser),g(roup),o(thers),a(ll)][+/-][r(ead),w(rite),(execute)] eg. chmod g+x frog.png
		* can do it one at a time or multiple at a time, similar to -al arguments above
* linux permissions for directories:
	* r(ead) - read contents of directory, eg. ls
	* w(rite) - write into the directory, eg. make new files
	* x(execute) - enter the directory, eg. cd
```

Here are my notes relevant to Section 9: Filters:

```
* head - print the first x (option -(number of)) lines of a file
* tail is to head as last is to first
* sort sorts sorts. (default alphabetical, other options available)
* nl numbers lines
* **put things including spaces in quotes so the system knows it's all one thing**
* wc - word count wowza
* cut does some fancy stuff with columns, when will this ever matter
* uniq gets rid of repeat lines
```

## Started [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x)

This is apparently the definitive Introduction to Computer Science course. It's wide-ranging and doesn't focus on syntax of a particular language, but CS fundamentals that apply across all languages. Within that, though, it's a little introduction to Scratch, C, JavaScript, SQL, and HTML/CSS.

Supposedly, this is legitimately difficult. You build something in code (and for half of the course, C) every single week. It takes self-paced learners as much time as it does for the actual Harvard students. This means I guess I'll be investing 40 hours a week into this course for 10-12 weeks.

This seems like a lot. This sounds like time I could be spending learning syntax & building projects. People get programming jobs in 4-6 months, and I'll be doing this course for the first 3? I don't know.

The final project is building a real project in code. It seems intense. I plan to commit to it, but I have heavy reservations of it eating up all of my time.

Every day that passes, my timeline seems to get pushed further and further back. I don't think I'll end up one of the rockstars who gets hired in 6 months.

I worked on Week 0 of 11 today. I finished it 4 hours faster than the average. I don't know if that's a testament to my skills, or a sign that I should've made my Scratch project more complex. I still don't really understand how to animate/make objects move in Scratch, but... Do I care?

Here is the link to my Scratch project: [The Banality of Water](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/193706945/)

It's an infinitely looping comic strip from a web comic I used to read.

I've been getting a few recommendations to go with other Intro to CS courses that aren't this one. I may change which course I do within the next few days. I haven't lost much thus far. I only want to take one definitive one, so I want to choose the right one.

Regardless, I'm not sure I'll be doing this every day. I think following week by week will give me more time to do other things.

## Tomorrow's To-Do's

I'm going to complete Section 10 of the CLI course on Grep. After that, I'll try to start Week 1 of CS50x. I don't plan to finish it in one day, and I probably won't.

So, I'm also going to be starting [Shay Howe's HTML/CSS course](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/). I'm not sure if I'm going to double-down and take the advanced course as well. We'll see.
